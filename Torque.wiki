* Most transmission clients have tons of information
	* Tremc is my current choice
	* Most of it don't understand, don't need

* Replace it with Torque
	* As minimal as you can get with an interface

* vim key scroll
* o to open magnet link
	* Maybe you were sent a link
* r to remove, give id
* s to start, give id
* p to pause, give id
* q to quit

* Missing information
	* Seeds/Leechers
	* Files would be nice to see
	* Amount you've seeded

* Installation
	* Dependencies
	* Transmission for obvious reasons
	* Bash it's a bash script
		* I didn't mention this
		* Torque just a 50 line bash script
		* So it shouldn't be too difficuly to edit yourself
