* Today we're looking at something kind of weird
  * This is a tool called tspreed
  * Supposed to help you read faster

== Functionality ==
* We need some test text
  * I'm just using description of Arch from the wiki

* Or you could convert a pdf
  * With something like pdftotext

* Now we just redirect it in
  * So this is default to 300 wpm
  * And I'd say it's perfectly readable
    * Could probably raise it up

* Quit with ctrl+c

* -w for wpm
  * minimum is 1
    * Don't think there's a max
    * But it'll be a blur way before then

* Enable focus line which points at the pivot character
  * Optimal recognition point
  * More on that soon
  * -f

* Change pointer style
  * -p line,point

* Change the focused letter color
  * -c ANSI 8-bit color

* Sometimes you might now want to start from the start
  * -n specify word start

* -l vary speed based on word length
  * I believe it still averages out to wpm

* Exit quietly
  * Don't show progress on exit
  * -q

* Show progress during the presentation
  * Which sort of defeats the point of the focus
  * -i

== Configuration ==
* All options can be set in config
  * ~/.config/tspreed/tspreed.rc
  * List of variables on the github
    * https://github.com/n-ivkovic/tspreed

== What's The Basis ==
* So this implements an idea known as speed reading
  * When you read you don't read along the line
  * You jump to each word and read from there
    * Typically jumping to the focus point of the word
  * This tool basically emphasises and helps you do that

* I'm not an expert
  * But it seems to be highly contested
  * Whether tools that emphasis this work
* Supposedly reading at 700+ words per min
  * With a tool like this and maintain high comprehension
  * But only in short bursts
* It's all well and good to read quickly
  * If not understanding it
  * No point

* I suggest trying it out
  * Seeing if you like it

== Nice Additions ==
* I feel like I'm reading faster than I otherwise would be
  * But I have some issues
* If I need to take a break
  * Maybe I'm going to sneeze
  * There's no way to pause the presentation
  * Also no way to step back or forwards
    * Your only option is to quit and restart from spot
    * Forgot about the text and keep going
  * Generally reading everything is the better solution
