* Session management isn't just limited to Tmux
	* Here we have abduco

* Create session and attach
	* abduco -c <name> <application>

* Apps have no trouble resizing
* No perceivable performance hit

* List sessions
	* abduco
	* * something connected
	* + terminated
	* blank waiting

* Reattach
	* abduco -a <name>

* Detach key
	* ctrl+\
	* Don't always want to quit terminal
	* Can be changed with -e
		* ^q ctrl+q

* Create session but don't attach
	* abduco -n <name> <application>

* Try to connect but create if doesn't exist
	* abduco -A <name> <application>

* Read only session
	* abduco -r <name> <application>
	* I'm sure there's a point
		* Not sure what it is though

* Run without app
	* Looks for dvtm
		* Dynamic virtual terminal manager

* Intended to be used alongside dvtm
	* A separate terminal multiplexer
	* Will do a further video on that

* What's the point of session management
	* Accidentally closing an application
		* No work lost
	* Quickly returning to previous state
		* Document state
		* Or with dvtm window layout
	* Like with tmux keeps applications running if ssh session closes
	* Need to run something such as game server
		* No easy way to background it
		* Bring it back to run commands
	* Want to run something in the background
