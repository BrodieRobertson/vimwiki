== 10K Celebration ==
* Thank luke
* Thank DT
* Thank friends
* Thank supports

== Lighting ==
* My lighting has needed some work for a while
	* I used to use 2 lights off to my left and right
	* Switched it around
		* 1 light is key light
		* 1 is hair light
		* Wall light, can be changed

== Video ==
* I'm noticing hardware limitations of C920
	* Planning to upgrade to a mirrorless camera
	* I'm thinking a Canon M200
		* Nothing set in stone yet
		* I know DT runs a Lumix G7 or G15
		* Come to the podcast for camera talk

== Audio ==
* Been using a blue yeti up until now
	* It's fine, I've tweaked it a bit
	* Sounds way better than it used
		* When I knew nothing about audio

* Feel it's time for an upgrade to XLR
	* Mixer Yamaha MG10XU
		* Very popular mixer board
		* Hardware knobs for everything
			* Compressor, EQ, Gain, Volume, built in FX
			* More inputs than I need
	* Microphone, probably Audio Technica AT2035

* A lot of streamers use Go XLR
	* One problem, with the software it's a brick
	* Unsurprisingly it's a brick on Linux

== Series Ideas ==
* My core content of Vim plugins and software showcases not changing
	* Keep cleaning up the rough edges

* May have noticed a new playlist called Unix History
	* Terrible name feel free to suggest a better one
* Right now contains XDG, Posix Compliance, Unix Philosophy
	* You guys seem to like them and I love making them
	* Maybe once a fortnight
		* All depends on having ideas
* Want to do video on how Linux came to be
	* Why GNU was created, C in a Unix context
	* Basically computing history from a Unix slant

* Found out running Wayland is super easy
	* Will likely start doing some content on that
	* Probably running Sway first up
		* But I'm just going to try out a bunch of stuff
	* Still heavily rely on X
		* Love BSPWM not leaving it permanently
		* Want to try something new out

== Streaming ==
* Done with Uni in Mid November
	* Will have way more free time

* Q&A content on this channel
	* Maybe some thumbnail creation streams

* Plan to start up a 3rd channel
	* Streams that don't fit main channel
	* Gaming content, and really anything else I want

* I will be doing it properly, if you tune in expect a show
	* I won't be doing what 99% of Twitch does
	* There will structure and I'll be trying to make it interesting
