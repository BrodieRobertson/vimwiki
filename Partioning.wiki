* What even is a partition
	* 1000GB drive to make maths easy
	* 2 sections managed independently
	* Give 1 700gb other 300gb
	* As many as you want
	* Can partition down as much as you want

* Partition table
	* 2 main partition tables on Linux
	* GPT GUID Partition Table
	* MBR Master Boot Record
		* Deserve until videos by themselves
	* Which one to use
		* UEFI in a lot of cases requires GPT
		* Drive bigger than 2TB GPT
		* MBR fine for Legacy BIOS systems

* Why partition
	* Dual booting with single drive
	* Swap space
		* Didn't like swap file
		* Using btrfs - limited features
	* Or even just logical seperation of files
	* Reinstall OS in case of problem
	* Simpler backups
		* Maybe don't care about enire drive backup
		* Just what's in home
	* Install across multiple drives

* Some minor drawbacks
	* Disk management more complex
	* Wasted space
		* Less of an issue on multiple drives

* Partition schemes
	* Partitionless disk superfloppy
		* No partition table
	* Outside of removable media though don't see point

	* Single root partition
		* Single parition
		* Swap space is a swap file
		* Reccomend against
		* Except for throwaway vm and removable media

	* Typically see discrete partition
		* root /
			* 15-20 gb
			* Gaming should be way more
		* /boot
			* Contains kernel and ramdisk image
			* Bootloader configuration file
			* 200 mb unless efi
			* 260 mb
			* Or just give it more to be safe
		* /var
			* Logs, pacman cache
			* Seperating it avoids running out space from logs
			* No really an issue on modern drives
		* Swap
			* Virtual ram
			* See my video on why it's important
		* /data
			* Files shared between users
		* /home
			* Whatever is left at end
		* Can have any other mount point
			* ~/videos

* Layout examples

* My scheme
