* Quite similar to another application I looked at
	* Clipmenu

* Stores a clipboard history
	* Never lose anything you copied

* Has some advantages
	* Some ability to store images
	* Limit of 500kb
		* Performance issues with larger files

* Intended to be used with rofi
	* Show command
rofi -modi "clipboard:greenclip print" -show clipboard -run-command '{cmd}'
* No issue with dmenu or any other dmenu compliant launcher
greenclip print | sed '/^$/d' | dmenu -i -l 10 | xargs -r -d'\n' -I '{}' greenclip print '{}'
	* Go over at the end

* greenclip daemon
	* Just leave always around

* greenclip print
	* Displays everything in clipboard history
	* image
		* type owner id

* greenclip clear
	* Anything that shouldn't be in there

* Settings are very basic
	* Generated when you run app
	* Static history is a mystery
	* Primary selection
		* 3 clipboards on X
		* Primary, secondary, clipboard
		* Anything highlighted is primary
	* Blackisted apps
		* Does it by clipboard name
		* A lot of apps don't name clipboard
			* QT and Chromium consistently do
			* Chromium just chromium
			* Firefox is good

* Command looks annoying always run from key
	* greenclip print we went over
	* Sed is clearing out any empty lines
	* Feel free to replace dmenu with fzf or anything else
	* xargs
		* -r don't run if empty
		* -d delimeter
		* -I replace string
			* Put text wherever this is
		* greenclip print with args
			* Modifies clipboard
			* Could use with anything else
			* Not documented

* Issues
	* No documentation
	* Binary history file
		* Not sure why
		* Images stored separately from history file
	* Played with images and xclip, had no issues with large files
		* Not sure what the issue is with this one
