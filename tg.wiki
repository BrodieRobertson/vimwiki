* I'm a very light telegram user
  * Found this terminal telegram client
  * tg

== First Launch ==
* Prompt you for phone number
  * Telegram code

== Keybindings ==
* Sadly can't be changed in config
* Help is context dependent

* up/down j/k
* up/down 10 J/K
* G jump to latest message
* g jump to top chat
  * No jump to bottom chat
* i/a write short message
* I/A write long message
* m: mute/unmute current chat
p: pin/unpin current chat
u: mark read/unread
* r short message
* R reply long message
* select message
* ctrl+[ clear selection

* ! show message with custom command
* y yank message
  * In clipboard also can be forwarded
* p to forward
* dd delete message

* [ previous chat
* ] next chat

* Send Files
  * sa send audio
  * sd send document
  * sn send animation
  * sp send picture
  * sv send video

* Chat creation
  * ng new group
  * ns new secret
  * c contacts
    * May not work because I have no contacts
    * Supposed to show an fzf selector

== Configuration ==
* Literally just a python script
* Over to github so I don't show phone number
* No documentation for full config

== File Opening ==
* Interacts with mail cap for file opening
  * Same as a lot of terminal email clients

== Issues ==
* bp breakpoint binding
  * Could tell you what it does
* No bot keyboard support
  * Only thing I actually use telegram for
* Resizing generally works
* In app documenation is out of date
* Not clear which window your focused on

* Very lacking compared to some discord terminal clients
  * There are probably better clients out there
