* Vim has some special folders in the vim runtime
	* Used for loading various pieces

* doc
	* Easiest of them all, this is documentation goes
	* Point :helptags path to it and it generates tags

* All have equivalents in /usr/share/vim/vim82/

* colors
	* Vim colour schemes
	* Say we have file called test.vim
		* Load with :color test

* ftdetect
	* Run everytime vim starts
	* Used to detect filetypes
		* Sometimes they'll be misconfigured
		* Sometimes making new file type

* ftplugin
	* Like colors naming matters
	* When vim loads it sets a file type
	* check with :set ft?
	* When file of that type loaded matching ftplugin file loaded
		* Only set local buffer options
		* Otherwise overwriting all open buffers
	* Will also run directories

* syntax
	* similar to colors
	* But for defining syntax rules on file types

* indent
	* Work the same way as ftplugin
		* Used for setting indentation settings
	* Could use ftplugin, just convention

* compiler
	* Should set compiler related options
		* compiler gcc
		* make %
		* Generally outside of the scope for most people

* plugin
	* Code you want to run everytime vim starts
	* Anything else that doesn't fit

* autoload
	* Delay the loading of code until it's needed
		* Show website example

* after
	* Sort of just a hack directory
	* Loaded after plugin
	* Allows you to override vim internals

* This is how plugins are layed out
	* Show example
