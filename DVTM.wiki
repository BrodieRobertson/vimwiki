* I looked at standalone session management
	* Here's standalone terminal window management

* Like tmux everything behind a mod key
	* I like ctrl-z
		* set to ctrl-g by default

* mod-c create new tile
* mod-C create new tile in working directory
* mod-x x to close window
	* exit works as well

* mod-j next window
* mod-k previous

* Takes the dwm approach to tiling
	* Master and tile nodes
	* Cycle Mod-space
	* Defaults to vertical stack mod-f
		* Grid mod-g
		* Bottom stack mod-b
		* Fullscreen mod-m
		* Others exist enable and recompile

* Change number of masters
	* mod-i increase
	* mod-d decrease
	* ctrl-enter cycle current window

* Hide some with mod-.
* Bring back with mod-num
	* Only if 10 or less

* But you could also use tags
	* Bit different from tabs
	* Apply tag
		* mod-t-3
	* Keeps window on both screens
		* mod-T-3
	* Changes view without changing tags
		* mod-V-3
	* Switch
		* mod-f*

* Copy mode
	* mod-e

* Prefer mouse support
	* -M

* Bring up man at any point
	* mod-?

* Want session as well just run with abduco
	* abduco -c dvtm-session

* Nice to use if you run st without scrollback

* Seems to have initialization issue in alacritty
	* st works perfectly

* Breaks true color apps
	* Due toncurses limitations
