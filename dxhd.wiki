* Some window managers don't come with any hotkey daemon
  * dxhd
  * Inpired by sxhkd

* Provides some interesting advantages over sxhkd
  * Typical choice

== Mapping ==
#super + F12
#super + @F12

== Mouse Binding ==
#mouseN
#@mouseN
#ctrl + mouse1
* Seems to break with super

== Variants ==
{F10, F11, F12}
$TERMINAL, $BROWSER, urxvt

== Ranges ==
{0-9}{a-z}
* Unlike sxhkd happily goes past
{11-19}
* Say you have 20 workspaces

== Language Support ==
* Use a shebang
* Sxhkd relies on environment variable
  * Forcing all config files to be same language

* Show python example

== Global Variables ==
* Define above all commands
  * Can be used like any variable
* Syntax depends on the language

== Config Creation ==
* .config/dxhd.sh default
* -c select config to use
* -e to create a new config

== Multi Line ==
* Due to the structure
  * Scripting is much easier
  * Anything between 2 blocks is script
    * No need for multiline
    * Def functions
    * Variables anything you want

== Converting Sxhkd Config ==
* Keymapping starts with @
* Command at start rather than indented

* Can do comments
  * Comments start with ##

* Basically converting involves changing
  * Keymap
  * Command
  * Other sxhkd syntax compatible

* dxhd -r reload the config in place

== Issues ==
* Doesn't daemonize properly from launcher
