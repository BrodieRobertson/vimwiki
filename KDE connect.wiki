* While back did a video on tool to transfer file
	* Phone to desktop

* People mentioned KDE connect
* This does far more than just transfer files
	* Infact right now why I'm controlling my cursor with my phone
	* Why is this a feature
		* Why indeed
	* Cursor disappearing due to other program
		* Not issue with this

* Run commands from phone
	* Example launching terminal
	* Much better use would be sending a file to your computer
		* Printing it

* Send clipboard from your phone
	* Probably more convenient than messaging myself

* Multimedia control
	* Can be done in both directions
	* All the basic controls you want
	* Nice to hook up a cheap PC to nice audio system
		* And remote control it
	* Other direction not so nice
		* Audio slider is very broken
		* Some apps don't even show song length

* File transfer
	* In my case seems to only work in one direction
		* No issues transferring from phone to desktop
		* Cannot get it to work in the other direction

* Kdeconnect-handler --open
	* Relies on file transfer working

* Take a photo and transfer to computer
	* Only from cli
		* Not everything can be done here
		* But most can

* Notification sharing
	* Seems to work well from android to PC
		* Not in reverse, not really a big deal

* Unless disabling screen blanking
	* Have to keep phone plugged in
	* Loses connection otherwise

* Make sure to run /usr/lib/kdeconnectd
	* Probably won't be in your path

* KDE SMS
	* Neat feature
		* Would be really cool but doesn't seem to work on my version

* Slideshow remote
	* We have this pointer thingy
	* Can supposedly switch through slides
		* I've had no luck

* Seems like an interesting idea but at least with a Realme 5
	* Completely unstable for most functionality
	* Maybe permissions error
		* If it is app gives no indication of it
	* The android side does seem a bit more table though

* Seems like a cool toy with some useful features
	* But at least for me the most useful don't work
