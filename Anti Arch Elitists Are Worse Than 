* Heard plenty of times that Arch is full of elitists
	* Nobody is helpful
	* You'll be sent away for questions
	* Outside of a tiny minority, basically don't exist
	* Maybe they did in the past
	* No where popular on Arch

* Very frequently are people complaining about Arch
	* Complaining about people using Arch
	* Talking about Arch
	* Recommending Arch
	* Anywhere complainers visit they don't exist
	* Maybe moved onto Gentoo, Void or BSD, no idea, not involved

* Arch is basically the noob distro for people who have free time
	* Thanks to Linux creators
	* And is incredibly well documented
	* Arch Wiki
	* If You haven't visited it, do it
	* It's a great tool regardless of distro
	* Linux creators frequently use Arch
	* Myself being one but there are plenty far more popular examples
	* Doesn't hold your hand like Ubuntu
	* If you want that good for you, it's not for me or lot's of others

* Obviously it's not for everyone
	* Some people don't have time or interest in configuring
	* But people wanting to and sharing it isn't a slight

* I want to address "btw I use Arch"
	* Gets posted online a lot
	* It seems like some people treat this as an attack
	* On their character
	* On their ability to use Linux
	* Or as a demand to use Arch rather than what they use
	* It's not
	* This probably seems obvious to most people
	* "btw I use Arch" is a joke
	* Not an attack, you or anyone
	* Just a joke
	* Or a meme as the kids would say
	* As in not serious
	* Like with Arch Elitists maybe it was serious
	* Not now

* Usually to rile someone up
	* They know someone will get angry

* What about not answering questions
	* Generally it can be answered with first search result
	* What does this error mean
	* Literally says the problem
	* When it's an actual problem
	* People are more helpful than they need to be

* Time for couch psychology
	* Feel inferior for not using Arch/Gentoo/Void
	* They attack people who do put in the effort
	* Rather than trying to improve
	* Or they simply don't know it's meme
	* Obviously no idea but that's my thought

* Stop caring about what other people use
	* It doesn't effect you at all
	* If they want to use Electron that's ok
	* If they want to use a window manager that's ok
	* If they want to use Arch, that's also ok
	* Usually don't care how people feel
	* But stop fighting
	* You are fighting an invisible enemy
