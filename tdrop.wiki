* Terminal looks a bit different today
	* This is a dropdown/scratchpad terminal
	* Dropdown wrapper
	* WM independent, terminal independent
		* A lot of scratch pads depend on WM

* Basically toggleable floating terminal
* Show luc use case

* tdrop -a alacritty
	* -a automatically determines hook for wm
	* Works perfectly in bspwm
	* Supported list on github

* -m resize based on monitor
	* Doesn't size properly

* Can be fixed with -w and -h
	* No mention in docs but -m seems to be required
	* Percent or pixel

* When changing command sometimes it breaks alacritty
	* Not an issue in real world usage
	* Set and forget
	* Or just use st

* Offset can be fixed with -x and -y
	* Takes negative

* multiple instances -n

* -s attach to tmux session

* Where it gets neat is hooks
	* -c pre create
	* -C post create
	* -p premap
	* -P postmap
	* -u preunmap
	* -U postunmap
	* -l pre float
	* -L post float

* tmux people are probably going to just say use tmux for persistent sessions
	* But if that's all you want from it this is much lighter
