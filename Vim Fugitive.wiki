* Wrapper around git
	* Not just a simple wrapper
	* Makes it much easier to run git commands inside vim

* Asked to cover for a while
* It's absolute worth using
* Up there with Emmet and Vimwiki for me

* Main usage is :Git/:G
* A wrapper around every git command
* More than just !git
* Some behave the same way
	* git status

* git log/git diff
* Shell version just basic output
* Allows searching
	* Save the output, regular vim movement
* Need to keep log open
	* Can't be done with shell version

* git add/git restore
* Silent command
* Shell version forces you to press enter
* Still shows errors

* git commit/git rebase
* Doesn't even work as a shell command
* Opens a split

* git mergetool/git difftool
* Load changes into window

* G by itself
	* Stripped down git status
	* g? brings up bindings

* Gedit/Gsplit
	* Open older versions of files
	* :Gedit HEAD~3
	* :Gedit HEAD~3:%

* :Gdiffsplit
	* Diff between staged version and working tree version

* :Gread
	* Variation of git checkout -- filename
	* Checkout file inside vim
	* undo with u

* :Gwrite
	* writes to both the work tree and index versions of a file

* :Ggrep
	* Runs git grep
* Glgrep
	* Runs lgrep

* :Gmove
	* Runs git mv
* :Grename similiar but relative to current directory

* Gdelete
	* Runs git rm
	* Delete file and delete from buffer
* Gremove
	* Same but keeps buffer open

* Gbrowse
	* Open remote
	* Need a handler
