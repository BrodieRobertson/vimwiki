* Use shell script to create GTK interfaces
	* Add gui components into your pipelines

== Basic Usage ==
* GTK has a lot of built in components
	* Want a file picker
		* yad --file
			* outputs file path
	* Color picker
		* yad --color
			* Outputs selected colours
	* Calendar
		* Outputs date
			* yad --calendar
	* Notification
		* Adds an icon to your system tray

* Could just do an entire video on these premades
	* All of these are super useful
* Can all be customized with options

== Examples ==
yad --title="Select a file to remove" --file --geometry=800x500+100+100
yad --title "Select Host" --entry --text "Select the host you would like to flood-ping"
yad --image "dialog-question" --title "Alert" --button=yad-yes:0 --button=yad-no:1 --text "Microsoft Windows has been found! Would you like to remove it?"
yad --list --checklist --column "Buy" --column "Item" TRUE Apples TRUE Oranges FALSE Pears FALSE Toothpaste
	* After running could save to a file
yad --notification --text "System update" --command "$TERMINAL -e sudo pacman -Syu"
fd "png" $HOME  | yad --list --title "Search Results" --text "Finding all png files" --column "Files" --close-on-unfocus

== File Picker Options ==
* --filename set directory
* --directory only select dir
* --save save mode instead of select

== Color Picker Options ==
--init-color
--alpha
--mode=hex/rgb output value

== Text Entry ==
* This has some interesting options
--hide-text
--numeric
--float-precision

== Advanced Examples ==
* Each of these could take an entire video by themselves
	* https://sanana.kiev.ua/index.php/yad

* This was the GTK3 version
	* https://github.com/step-/yad
	* If you like GTK2 there is a fork for that

== Issues ==
* Example documentation seems a bit out of date
* Application doesn't error with incorrect options

== Conclusion ==
* I wanted you guys to know this exists
	* I'll be coming back to it as I use it in projects
