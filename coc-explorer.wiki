* Recently switched to fern.vim
	* Comments were full of have you tried coc-explorer

* File info

* File listing
	* gf
	* Navigation
		* l to open or expand
		* h to close
		* enter to cd into dir or switches back to buffer
		* backspace to cd up
* Remembers position after reopen

* Buffers opened
	* gb

* Action menu
	* tab
	* As always it's best to use bindings
	* Includes you binding changes
	* As does the help

* All config done through coc config
	* Would really suggest doing messing with keys
	* Especially if coming from other file manager
	* Nerd font icons

* Splits, Vsplits
	* Demo

* File Operations
	* Bit different to other file trees
	* cut, copy, paste operations
		* X, Y, P

* Fuzzy finder on open dir
	* f

* Git integration
	* gp gitPrev
	* gn gitNext
	* ga gitStage
	* gu gitUnstage
		* Typically don't bother with
	* Symbols can be configured

* Recursive folder open
	* Would suggest unmapping
		* If run on big folder, will freeze

* Floating
	* Don't see often
	* explorer.position
		* left, right, tab, floating
	* explorer.floating.position
		* width, height, contentWidth

* Breaks a little with easy motion

* Selection doesn't work properly

* Doesn't seem to have an easy quit as last buffer
	* Everything is really cool
	* Could adapt netrw hack

* Seems to be about as fast as fern
	* Not sure if I'd use extra features
	* Plus I'm not a big fan of being tied to Coc
