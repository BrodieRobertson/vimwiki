== My Thoughts ==
* I'm going to say Linux
  * But referring to Unix in general
  * So don't @ me BSD users
* Can't speak for anyone else
* I hear a lot of people talk about privacy
  * FOSS ideology
  * Not wanting to pay for an OS
    * Less of an issue nowadays unless you're a business

== Tinkering ==
* If I narrow it down to one point it's freedom
  * The freedom to install what I want
  * The freedom to customize it as much as I want
  * The freedom to live without a GUI
  * Or run something so heavy it needs 32gb of ram to boot

* Not to say you can't customize Windows or Macos
  * But it's to a whole nother on Linux

* For example I run a window manager
  * Does what it says on the tin
  * It comes with a tool
    * Let's me control the exact layout of my windows
  * Or I can let it do it automatically

* Or I've got a hotkey daemon called sxhkd
  * Where I can control basically action of my system from a key press
  * I know AutoHotkey exists
    * With how much control Linux apps give you
    * You can do so much more with this

== New Titles ==
* I'm not big into Linux gaming right now
  * But from what I've seen Proton is getting better every day
  * https://www.protondb.com/
  * https://www.gamingonlinux.com/
* DRM is a major issue
  * Kernal level DRM is going to break on Linux
  * Sometimes it can be fixed
    * Sometimes it can't
* But you never have to go in blind
  * Do your research

== Drivers ==
* If you buy hardware on launch day you're asking for trouble
  * No way to get around it
  * Nvidia also has notoriously buggy drivers
    * Even months after launch
* The community is very quick to come up with solutions
  * Sometimes fixed on the launch day
* Even on Windows you shouldn't buy on launch day
  * There are bound to be problems

* As for less popular hardware
  * Printers are well
    * Let's just say a windows vm isn't always a bad idea

== Distro Disparities ==
* Point made from the perspective of not using Linux
  * Run what you want I don't care

* The biggest disparity between distros is software availability in repos
  * Only really an issue when you explore
  * Popular tools will be everywhere
    * Except for tiny distros no one really uses

* I don't watch Jay much anymore
  * When I see this point usually being made it's in relation to GUI disparity
  * The way the desktop environment is configured
* But it's just that the way the desktop environment is configured
  * Your major options are KDE, Gnome, XFCE
  * If you install Ubuntu with Gnome and you see another distro with Gnome
    * Will look different but it's just a theme
