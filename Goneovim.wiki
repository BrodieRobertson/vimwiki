	* Here we have a Goneovim

* Ligature support
	* I've never been much of a fan

* Minimap
	* GonvimMinimap

* Markdown preview
	* GonvimMarkdown

* Workspaces
	* Create new workspace
		* GonvimWorkspaceNew
	* Go to next workspace
		* GonvimWorkspaceNext
	* Go to previous workspace
		* GonvimWorkspacePrevious
	* Go to workspace
		* GonvimWorkspaceSwitch
	* Can navigate into folder with enter
		* Not sure how to leave

* Session Management

* Built in tab line


* Different fonts for different windows
	* GonvimGridFont "Fira Code:h14"

* Fuzzy finder
	* Additional plugin
	* Just a gui version of fzf
		* No point imho

* Indent Guide
	* Doesn't seem to work though

* Transparency

* Render bug with spell check

* No backup fonts

* Config is locked to home

* If you're in desperate need of ligatures
	* This is an alternative to a terminal

* Workspaces are cool
	* Need some work
	* But there's not much else here for me
