* Go to install something with npm
	* See this screen
	* Have to install program with sudo
	* Read online about why you shouldn't do this
	* Basically giving untrusted code admin access

* Changing owner of npm folder
sudo chown -R $(whoami) ~/.npm
	* May fix it depending on issue
	* Don't make /usr accessable by you

* Changing global npm install location
	* mkdir ~/.npm-global
	* npm config set prefix '~/.npm-global'
export PATH=~/.npm-global/bin:$PATH
	* npm install -g jshint

	* NPM_CONFIG_PREFIX=~/.npm-global

* Use NVM
* https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm
	* Bash script for maintaining multiple installs
	* Install from AUR
	* Source file for shell
	* nvm install node
	* Stable node version
	* Managed by node package manager package manager
	* Best fix for multiple npm versions
	* Uninstall manual
		* Deal with nvm with package manager
		* Delete nvm directory yourself
		* Remove line from rc

* Skip package manager
	* Webi or web install
	* Wouldn't recommend
curl -s https://webinstall.dev/node | bash
	* webi node@v12
	* npm install -g prettier
