* Been jumping back and forth between lf and vifm
	* Thought I should give some more extended thoughts

== Things I Like ==
* Folder previews
	* lf just shows you what's in folder
	* vifm can preview however you want
		* Maybe you only care about permissions and size
		* show example

* Default Settings
	* Besides fixing High middle low
		* Most settings left default

* Amazing documentation
	* Best for any terminal file manager
	* Ranger is the only closest
		* Besides good external docs
		* Default config is incredibly well documented
		* Some might say too much
			* I would never agree
		* Alacritty does the same

* Undo and redo is amazing
	* Should be a feature in every file manager

== Configuration ==
* On that topic
	* Vim style configuration is amazing
	* Some may not like but from someone who uses vim a lot
		* Well understood easy to convert lf bindings to

== Don't Like ==
* Selection doesn't toggle
	* I know you can use visual mode
	* Sometimes doesn't want to select full list
	* I may be missing something
		* Even if I am, lf was super intuitive
	* 2 visual blocks
		* I know this is vim behavior
		* Makes some operations harder
		* Visual - selection works
			* Not other direction

== Performance ==
* File previews induce performance drop
	* Mentioned in original video
	* Only got more annoying
		* Generally fine on folders like home
		* On videos it's unusably slow
			* Fine once cached
	* Can't make lf do this
		* Loads in background rather than pausing app

* Slow at bringing combinations
	* I get that there's a lot of bindings
	* Shouldn't take nearly a second to load
	* lf does this instantly

== Aesthetics ==
* I know it's minor
* I really like the bar borders of lf
	* Can be tweaked in vifm
	* Vertical border doesn't seem possible

== Don't Care About ==
* Bulk renaming
	* It's an awesome feature when I need it
	* But I've had it working in lf for months

* Sessions are a neat feature
	* But I want file manager to always open where I open it
	* If I don't I'll tell it where to open
		* My opinion

== Conclusion ==
* Don't get me wrong
	* This is a really good file manager
	* But I don't use most of the features
		* Lf is lightning fast
