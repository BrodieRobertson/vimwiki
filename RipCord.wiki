* A lot of the client we've been through have just been ok
	* Missing a lot of features
	* Not ripcord

* This thing does almost everything that Discord does
	* Don't believe
	* And more in some ways

* Also can be a slack client
	* Can't comment on quality

* Looks a little different but very easy to get used to
	* Tagging @
	* Emotes and emoji :
	* Uploading file

* Very lightweight and very fast
	* As expected from not using electron
	* Ctrl+k better way to move around

* Number, seems to sometimes indicate new messages
	* Other times not
	* Regardless shows which chat has a new message

* Or there is an emoji button
	* Can search works great
	* If I had nitro I presume I would see other server emotes
		* Can't confirm

* Server moderation gear
	* Changing roles
	* Kicking/banning
	* But also actual admin tools

	* Roles in single or matrix
	* Disable invites

* Invite +

* Upload file ^

* Pinned messages

* Notification s

* Reorder your server list

* Extra features
	* Channel bookmarks

	* Theming
		* Like BetterDiscord
		* Theming is here

	* Tabs
		* Why does Discord need tabs
		* I don't know but it's cool

* There's voice chat
	* This might be the only 3rd party client that does

* Where is it lacking
	* Doesn't play gifs
	* Videos
	* Or Music
		* Can click to open in browser
	* Emoji in channel name broken out of box
		* Can be fixed
	* No video chat
	* No spell check
	* Server ember names not grouped
	* Message searching

* This isn't open source
	* It's shareware
	* However, the official client isn't open either
	* And I feel this is better in many ways
		* In the end still on discord or slack

* I could keep talking about this software all day
	* Not often that I replace something on this channel
	* But I might just use Discord web only for the podcast
