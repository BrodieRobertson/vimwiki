* Describes itself as a space age sed
  * Nonsense description
  * It's a batch search and replace tool
  * With diff functionality

== Basic Functionality ==
* Completely relies on external program for file name
* Want to modify single file
  * Echo

* Takes 2 positional arguments
  * Match pattern
    * Show regex example
  * Replace pattern
    * Can be left empty to delete

* Opens fzf to show you changes
  * At this stage nothing has changed
  * Anything selected in here will be saved
* Multi enabled by default
  * tab shift+tab

* Want to modify a bunch
  * Find or fd
  * If you want to use a file
    * Uses new line seperated paths
    * -0 Can use \0 the null character seperator
      * Can't see a use case but it's there

== Regex Flags ==
* By default uses smart case and multiline
* Set flags with -f
  * i case insensitive
  * I case sensitive
  * m multiline ^$ matches a line
  * M singleline ^$ matches the document
  * s allow . to match \n
  * x ignore whitespace and allow comments

== Fixed String Match ==
* -e
  * Can be emulated with regex
  * But comes with the benefit
    * Not having to escape regex special chars

== Colourizer ==
* In the docs it's called the pager
  * Which is not even remotely accurate
  * Let's user diff-so-fancy
  * -p

== Disable Fzf ==
* Outputs all the diffs directely to the terminal
  * Stick them in a pager
  * Preferably a nice diff highlighting pager
* Save changes with --commit
  * Don't care about changed files
    * Redirect to /dev/null

== Issues ==
* Sed is more than just search and replace
  * Tool would be better off distancing itself from that
* Rather than handling basic things gives to user
  * file name argument
  * quiet output
    * include a -q that does redirect for user
* Documentation severely lacking
  * No man page
  * Constant references to pattern
    * No indication of the pattern
      * Inferred it was regex
      * Still don't know type of regex
* 2 options listed as internal use only
  * internal-patch
  * internal-preview
    * Shouldn't be shown to the user if not intended for thier use
