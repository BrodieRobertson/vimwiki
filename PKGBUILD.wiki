		* In my follow up I'll talk about naming rules
	* pkgver
		* required
		* Version of the package
		* For timpstamped versions use ISO 8601
		* Binaries use the release number
		* VCS we'll look at some functions later
	* pkgrel
		* reqired
		* Release number of the package
		* Used to indicate fixes and features to PKGBUILD
	* epoch
		* Typically avoided
		* Forces a package to be seen as newer
		* Used when versioning changes breaking comparison logic

		* Describes the program
		* Reccomend 80 characters or less
		* Don't include name

		* array

		* For example plasma is a group
	* depends
		* Very important
		* Array
		* Build and runtime dependencies
		* depends=('foobar>=1.8.0' 'foobar<2.0.0')
		* depends=('git')
		* So dependencies can be ignore, glibc for example
		* No harm in including
	* optdepends
		* May limit functionaly of program
		* Array
		* But it will still function
		* List alternative dependencies
		* Xdo or xdotool for example
		* optdepends=('cups: printing support'
            'sane: scanners support'
            'libgphoto2: digital cameras support'

            'libpng: PNG images support')
		* makedepends
			* Very important
			* array
			* Required to build software
			* Anythingalso required to run should only be in depends
			* No duplicates
		* checkdepends

* Functions
	* prepare
		* Get ready for building
		* Unarchive is skipped by noextract
		* Patching
