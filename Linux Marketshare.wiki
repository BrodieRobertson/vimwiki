== Intro ==
* Every month up to June article like this
	* https://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2020/05/linux-marketshare-april-2020

* I and many people talked about it
	* Because maybe Linux marketshare was really rising
	* But I was still sceptical
	* Rightly so

== News ==

* As of Septembers numbers
	* Everything is back to where it was in March

* Read Paragraph 1, 2 and 3

* Is it possible that that this happened sure
	* But I still don't see it as the most likely explanation
	* Initially I thought June onwards was interesting
		* We have to go back to March

== My Explanation ==

* General Linux market shar is always above Ubuntu
	* RedHat, Fedora have own categories

* What happened after March data point
	* Ubuntu 20.04 LTS dropped
	* Could potentially explain the growth

* Let's go back to 19.04
	* Absolutely no noticeable change

* What's changed since then
	* WSL has been gaining a lot of traction amoung Windows devs
		* WSL2 available to Windows insiders as of June 2019
			* If you care about cutting edge features probably an insider
			* Publically available as of May 2020
	* Lockdowns
		* Lends credibility to trying out Linux because bored
		* Following logic, people go back to Windows as many places open
	* Lockdown another interpretation
		* Look at methodology
		* Read definition of data
			* How do we define session
			* Cookie, Log IP, with account you can have user id

		* Account isn't likely
		* First 2 don't follow the user
		* Show diagram

* Ultimately no one factor is at play
	* All of these involved
	* Plus others I didn't think about

* Other sources show no change at all over the year

	* Sadly doesn't show distro breakdowns

== Don't Use Stats Blindly==

* Don't just blindly trust a statistic
* Look into where the data is coming from
	* How it was collected
	* How you could game the collection
	* Any flaws that exist
	* If the intrepretation doesn't mention those
		* Take it with a grain of salt
