* All my apps I've either installed from package manager
	* Or from source
	* But other ways exists
	* Like Snaps, flatpaks
		* AppImage
		* But what exactly is an AppImage
		* What is even the point
	* Never have to use if you don't want

* Dependencies are a major issue on Linux
	* libraries, fonts, icons, applications
		* Sometimes named differently
		* Sometimes don't exist in standard repos
			* Take anything in AUR
* App image more than just an app binary
	* Contains everything app needs to run

* Why use them
	* One format for all distros
		* No need for debian package, arch package, void package, so on
	* Generally works out of box, no runtime dependencies
		* Technically need fuse
	* No need to compile apps
		* Installation is however long download takes
		* Windows esc installation
	* No root needed to install
		* Can have app images that require root
	* Updates handled within the application
	* Preserves old applications with old dependencies
		* Requires ancient version of gtk
		* May be other conflicts

* Why not
	* Some reason why they're useful are why they're not
	* Bundling dependencies
		* Every time you need access to a library need to download
		* Rather than using system library
	* Updates circumvent package manager
	* Windows style installation
		* Download an app from devs website
		* Some stores
		* Downloading from 3rd party website introduces Windows security vulnerability
	* Generic builds are going to be slower
		* Not an issue on desktop everyone uses x86 or x86_64
		* ARM is a different story though
	* Lose ability to do package manager operations
		* List, Uninstall

* Here's where we get somewhere weird
	* Being windows esc installations you would think no need for a package manager
	* Old habits die hard
	* https://github.com/michaeldelago/aipm
	* We've come full circle
		* Obviously don't need it and shouldn't use it
		* But amuses me
		* Idea of single executable so alien to Linux users
		* Try to rengineer it as package

* Installation process
	* Requires a working fuse installation
	* On arch just need to install fuse2
		* Reboot
	* Download app image
	* Make exectable
	* Done
