* I might just make it a thing to look at rust apps
  * This time wasn't on purpose
  * Rewrite of fzf in rust called skim
  * fzf was written in Go
    * So what is this

== Basic Usage ==
* Just like fzf
* enter to select
* scroll with up/down ctrl+j ctrl+k
* -m multi select
  * tab select move down
  * Shift-tab select move up

== Search Syntax ==
* Same as fzf never talked about though
* Obvious just type
* ^match at start
* match$ at end
* 'exact match
* !inverse match
* !do$ not end in match
* | or
* white space and

== Command Mode ==
* Onto some new stuff
* Filter based on file and contents
* Any grep like tool will work
sk --ansi -c 'grep -rI --color=always --line-number "{}" .'
  * --ansi interpret ansi colors
  * -c define command mode command
  * ripgrep, ack, and ag examples on GitHub
* ctrl-q to switch to command mode
* start in interactive -i
* prompt text
* -p
* Cmd prompt text

== Pre-selection ==
* In multi select mode
  * Select items before user selections
* --pre-select-n=2
  * Select number of items
* --pre-select-pat="\.*jpg"
  * Select by regex
* --preselect-select-items='./dmtpfs'
* --preselect-select-items='./dmtpfs\n./dman'
  * Select by file name
* --pre-select-file=FILENAME
  * New seperated list of files names
    * Same as last just in a file

== Scripting Options ==
* -q start with given query
* -cmd-query same but for cmd query
* --print-query

== Fuzzy Algorithm ==
* Different from fzf
  * Doesn't seem to be noticably different
    * Results or speed
  * Can be changed
    * --algo=skim_v2 default, skim_v1 clangd

== Rust Library ==
* Don't know rust but this does have a neat feature
* Skim is also a rust library

== Speed Doesn't Matter ==
* Both fzf and skims speed are controlled by population command
  * FZF_DEFAULT_COMMAND and SKIM_DEFAULT_COMMAND
  * Both are just lightweight interfaces

== FZF ==
* Most of the rest just reimplementation of fzf
  * Some stuff may be missing
  * But what's there is just what fzf does

== Issue ==
* Don't let you switch to command mode with no command

== Final Thoughts ==
* Command mode actually pretty neat
  * Could see myself using it a lot
  * Besides that it's just fzf
