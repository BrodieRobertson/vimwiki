* When installing linux you configure swap
	* What does it do?
	* How big should it be?
	* Do you need it?

* Linux divides its physical RAM into chunks of memory called pages.
	* Check page size
	* getconf PAGESIZE
* Swapping is the process whereby a page of memory is copied to the preconfigured space on the hard disk, called swap space, to free up that page of memory.
	* In short swap turns part of hard drive into memory
	* Much slower
	* But better than nothing
* The combined sizes of the physical memory and the swap space is the amount of virtual memory available.

* Check swap
	* swapon --show
	* free -h

* Two ways to configure swap
	* Swap partition
		* More popular
	* Swap file
	* Arch Wiki claims no performance difference
	* Are differences, will explain in a bit

* Before that
* Two main reasons for use
	* Extend memory as mentioned earlier
	* Small amount of RAM
		* 4 - 8GB basically essential
		* Avoids out of memory conditions
		* Linux will try to free up memory
		* Better to avoid though
		* More swap, more programs can be run at once
		* Don't go overboard
			* 100GB will be lot's of memory
			* CPU can't deal with that many apps
			* No point
		* Can avoid if drive space valuable
			* Not much of a problem with modern drives

		* Hibernation
			* Suspend to disk
			* Ram copied to hard drive
			* If doing this swap should be ram size
			* Can be successful without it
				* Guarenteed requires at least ram size

* Swap partition
	* Don't fix what isn't broken
	* If can afford dedicated space
	* Just do swap parition
	* Pre Linux Kernel 5.0 BTRFS didn't support swap file
		* Now has limited support

* Swap file
	* On the fly resizing
	* Disk space at a premium
		* Old hardrive/small SSD
		* Still want it
		* Don't need all the time

* Swap space rules of thumb
	* Double you RAM
	* Ram x1.5
	* Depends on how much you have
	* 8GB should I would use
		* x1.5
	* 4Gb or less I would use
		* Double
	* I did x1.5
		* 48GB of swap
		* Way overkill
		* Equal would have been fine

* So do you need it
	* Depends
	* Do you do memory intensive work
		* Run out frequently
	* Low memory in general
	* Or want to hibernate
	* Then yes

	* If you never hibernate
	* Never run out of RAM
	* I guess not
	* But It's better to be safe
