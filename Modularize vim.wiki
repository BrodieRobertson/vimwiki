* My vim config looks way different from normal
* All the functionality is still there

* Modularized vim config

* Trade off for debugging
	* Vim won't spit line number errors
	* Allows for modular testing
		* Ignore rest of config
		* Test one part

* Dead simple maintainence
	* Neat seperation
	* Dependent on you
	* Know where all located

* Easily shareable
	* If you want my autocmds
	* Now just take that one file
	* Rather than digging through config

* Update parts of vimrc without resourcing
	* Sometimes reloads plugins
	* Slowing the app down

* Easily load parts based on conditional
	* Can be done with regular vimrc
	* But can see the bottom

* Depending on plugin manager
	* Easily disable plugin
	* Not convenient with vim-plug
	* Want to not source file and not load plugin

* Not most performant method
	* Slower hardware may be an issue
	* No perceivable difference on my system
	* Only on load

* Adding new files is easy
	* Make file
	* .vim not required just gives syntax highlighting
	* Do whatever regular config you want

* Not the only method to handle this
	* Create a build script with shell
	* Generate full vimrc
	* I find to be less convenient
	* Requires building a file when making changes
