* Cat plus syntax highlighting
* Doesn't get any simpler than that

== Git Integration ==
* Marks lines similar to gitgutter
* ~ for modified lines
* + for added lines
* - for removed lines

== Line Modifications ==
* -H  highlights lines
* -r show line range
  * Both use same syntax
  * 30 only
  * 30:40 range
  * :40 1 to 40
  * 40: to end

== Style ==
* Disable pager
  * --paging/er=never
    * BAT_PAGER set always
* --style=
  * BAT_STYLE set always
  * plain alias -p
    * plain plus no pager -pp
  * number -n
  * auto, full, changes, header, grid, snip
* Tons of info by default
* Can't use multiple styles at once outside of -n
* -A show unprintable characters

* --decorations
  * when to show decoration
    * auto, never, always

== Config File ==
* Poorly documented
* Simple structure though
  * --generate-config-file not in man
* Basically just passing in options

== Language ==
* Generally auto detects language
  * Can set if it doesn't
  * -L list all supported languages
  * -l to set any values in line
* Custom languages
  * Config location/syntaxes
    * Uses sublime text language files
      * Odd choice but it works
      * More support

== Theme ==
* List installed themes --list-themes
* Set theme with --theme
  * BAT_THEME set always
  * --color when to use theme
    * auto, never, always

* Installing new theme
  * Uses sublime text themes
    * Add to config location/themes
  * run bat cache --build
    * Adds to theme cache

== Why Use ==
* Typically use for terminal file manager previews
  * Great coverage, anything not supported
  * Fairly likely has a language file defined
