* Emulator debugging can only take you so far
* At some point have to debug on hardware
	* Or just skip emulator entirely
	* scrcpy for video
	* sndcpy for audio
		* No reason to cover by itself

* Obviously limited
	* No gesture controls
	* Multitouch
	* Computer camera

* Unlike emulator you still can do this form the device
	* Show you how to set phone up at the end

* Connecting multiple devices
* -s --serial
* adb devices

* --max-fps value

* Reduce lag on low end hardware
	* --bit-rate/-b 2M
	* I see no difference

* Resolution
scrcpy --max-size 1024

* Crop
* scrcpy --crop 1224:1440:0:0

* turn screen off
* -S

* stay awake
* -w --stay-awake

Record
-r/--record file file.name
--record-format mp4/mkv
Already have a recording app

Drag and drop files
* scrcpy --push-target /sdcard/foo/bar/

* Copy, cut, paste from system
* mod+c, mod+x, modv

* Keybindings for android actions
	* may not work properly on every device

* sndcpy has no options

* Setting it up is fairly easy
* Enable developer tools
* Enable usb debugging
* Plug in, enable PTP

* Wifi works as well, haven't tested it though
* For sndcpy just run, install recording app

* Mainly useful for developers
* But I have my own use cases
	* I could do mess around with termux
