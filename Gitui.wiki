* Typically not a fan of git interfaces
	* Usually will try to push you towards a specific workflow
	* Some more explicitly than others
		* GitHub, Turtle
	* Even this
* Need to use git
	* Don't want to remember commands
	* Maybe try out GitUI

* Basic demonstration
	* Stage
	* Go to staging area
	* Remove staged
	* Commit

* 4 tabs
	* Status
		* Serves as git status
	* Log
		* Serves as git log
	* Stashing
		* Files you can stash
	* Stashes
		* Stashes you have
	* I don't ever find myself using stashes

* Most bindings will be listed along the bottom

* On status
	* enter to stage
	* a to stage all
	* D to reset changes
	* i to add to gitignore
	* e to edit
	* right to diff
	* s to staging ares

* staged
	* c to commit

* Commit
	* ctrl-a amend

* staged
	* enter to unstage
	* a to unstage all
	* e to edit

* diff
	* enter add hunk
	* D revent hunk
	* e to edit

* log
	* t to tag

* stashing
	* i toggle staged
	* u toggle untracked

* And that's all
	* Big things are missing
	* Working with remotes
	* No pushing, pulling

	* No making branches, changing branches, merging branches

* This is what I mean by encouraging a workflow
	* If you rely on this you will not use branches, or remotes
