* Bspwm is a dynamic/automatic tiling window manager
  * It deals with tree by itself
  * But you can intervene in the layout
  * That's done with receptacle

== What is a Receptacle ==
* Bspwm stores every node in a binary tree
  * Any leaf node that doesn't contain a window is receptacle
* Show example

* Act like any other sort of node
  * Except they can't focused on
  * Targeting them is done in special way
  * Resizing in relation to other nodes
* Interact the same with other nodes
  * Show example
* And you can put windows in them

== Make A Receptacle ==
* bspc node -i

* Since we're manually tiling anyway
* Let's briefly look at preselection
  * Let's you control how windows get split
  * What we care about today is presel-dir
* bspc node --presel-dir CARDINAL -i

== Targetting ==
* We need some way to target it
bspc query -N -n .leaf.\!window
* Grab every leaf node
* Only return leaves with have no window
bspc query -N -n .leaf.\!window -d focused
* Limit to current desktop

* If you have multiple receptacle
  * Decide how to handle it
  * Newest, oldest, random
  * Closest relative, Direction

== Insert into receptacle ==
bspc node ID to add -n $(bspc query -N -n .leaf.\!window)

* Once a receptacle always a receptacle
  * Close the window it closes like normal

* Now we can do something interesting
bspc node @/ -B

== Clear all Receptacles ==
for win in `bspc query -N -n .leaf.\!window`; do bspc node $win -k ; done;
* May want to be more specific
  * Just yeets everything

== Useful Keybindings ==
* Only just started messing with this
super + r to move focused window into receptacle
super + i; h,j,k,l to select direction to spawn receptacle
super + shift + i clear all receptacle
super + e balances the nodes

== Closing Thoughts ==
* 99% of the time having dynamic tiling is fine
  * But having the option to manually tile when you need it is awesome
  * And let's you do some really cool things
