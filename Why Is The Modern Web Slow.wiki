= Why Is The Modern Web Slow =

* You actually can build websites with HTML and plain JS
  * https://thebestmotherfucking.website/
  * https://humm42.github.io/

* A bit of web history
  * Created by Netscape Corporation
  * Created to add interaction to websites
  * 2 options embed Java applications or embed Scheme langauge
  * In the end just made something new called JavaScript

* I don't hate JS
* Adding interaction to static websites is cool

* Eventually AJAX requests came in
  * Gained popularity in early 2000's
  * Allows for dynamic data without reloading the page
  * Makes Google Maps, Google Earth possible in a browser
* If we stopped here no one would have a problem

* Now here's where the problem started, it's name is JQuery

* Not inherently a bad idea
  * Mid 2000's JS was a compatibility mess
  * Jquery hid that away

* But people started building dynamic websites
* What's that you say
  * It's where you do everything in JS even static content

* Then a long came, Angular, React, Vue.js
  * JSX
  * Now we're embedding HTML into JS as if that's what we always did
  * Not even considered an option to build a static site

* However I am a massive hypocrite
  * I love React and I'm happy to use it

* It's very easy to add too much functionality to a page
