	* I'm always trying new stuff out
	* Some of you guys use different software to me
	* St being a good example
	* I'm on Alacritty now
	* Another is Firefox
	* I'm on Brave

* Software changes
	* Updates happen
	* Features are added/removed
	* I check in on software from time to time
	* Olive being a good example
	* Maybe I'll like it now

* I just generally like software
	* I like seeing what's out there
	* I'm thinking of trying dwm or Qtile when I'm on break
	* What's possible on Linux
	* Workflows that I haven't tried
