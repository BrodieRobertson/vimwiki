* Did a similar at the start of the year
  * Focused too specifically on my degree
  * Rather than offering solutions

== Major Issues ==
* Microsoft technologies
  * Dot net
  * WinForms, Asp.net
    * Lucky enough to use core it's no issue
    * C# tooling isn't great on Linux but it's functional
  * SQL Server Management Studio
    * SQL Server is on Linux

* Apple technologies
  * The vast majority of swift development
    * Language may appear in data science in the future

* Engine Game Development
  * Unity or Unreal
  * Yes they're supported
    * But typically you'll be required to run a specific version
    * VR course requires 2019.2.0
    * May have never hit linux
      * MacOS has the same issue

* Exams requiring respondus, lockdown browser
  * Simply not available on Linux

* If you have hardware requirements
  * Virtual machine is always an option
    * Getting MacOS ISO is annoying but there are ways
      * Even without owning a Mac
* Next best is picking up a 2nd hard drive and dual booting
  * 128gb SSD are dirt cheap now
  * Can always be wiped later and used as a backup drive

* Hire a VPS
  * https://www.macincloud.com/
  * Less common on windows

== Lecturers With Strict Document Requirements ==
* Most lecturers don't care about formatting
* Some do though
* When it's use this specific IEEE latex template
  * No issue
  * Latex engine in every standard repo
  * Or you can do it online in overleaf

* LibreOffice, OpenOffice, FreeOffice all great 99% of the time
  * Has some incompatibilities

* Never submit an ODT file
* Avoid doing docx if you can
* Try to submit pdf when possible
  * Will look the same on every system
* When you do need to submit docx
* Basically every school email gives access to Office 365
  * I don't like it but it's a good sanity check

== Non Issues ==
* When it comes to general programming
  * No reason to not be on Linux

* If you want an IDE like
  * Eclipse, JetBrains Suite, QT Creator, Android Studio
    * All on Linux and probably run better
* Code editors like
  * VS Code, Sublime Text Atom
* Build it yourself
  * Vim, Emacs

* UML is still cool
  * UMLet has a web version or it's just a Java app
  * Dia is my personal favourite

* Online lecturers
  * Popular tools like Webex, Zoom
    * Have web clients
  * Zoom also has Linux client

== Benefits ==
* Most of the time it's about the same
* There will come a point where everyone else needs a Linux VM
  * Linux introduction classes
    * bash scripting, core utils
  * Docker
    * Available on Windows, features missing
  * Big data Hadoop
