	* Especially moving between words
	* Fell in love instantly
	* Quickest way to move around
	* No more guessing
	* Everything is marked
	* Can't cover everything

* Covering default bindings
	* A ton of default bindings
		* Covering everything will take hours
	* Leader Leader
		* Avoids conflicts

* Would be easy if you had to learn new bindings
	* f find to right
	* F find to left
	* t before char right

	* ge end of word backward
	* gE end of word backward
	* j line down
	* k line up
	* n Jump to / or ? forward
	* N Jump to / or ? backward

* Rebinding
map <Leader>J <Plug>(easymotion-eol-j)
	* But maybe you want different behavior
	* t,T,f,F vanilla vim are single line
		* l bindings
	* 2 two char search
	* n n char search
	* l2
	* ln

	* vim compatible
		* consider direction for n & N

	* bd bidirectional
	* eol end of line
