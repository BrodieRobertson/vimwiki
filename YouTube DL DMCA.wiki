* Recently GitHub recieved a DMCA takedown notice for YouTubeDL
  * By the RIAA
  * Recording Industry Association of America, Inc.

* US Based music industry trade organization
  * Members in control of most of the VEVO channels
  * Some exist outside of the US
  * Claim to be responsible for 85% of
    * US music
  * Fairly big and powerful organization

== What Happened ==
* 18 Repos were taken down

* Still under Digital Millenium Copyright Act
  * Plaguing YouTube and Twitch
  * Very wide reaching
  * YouTube DL isn't in violation of copyright
    * It's claimed to be a DRM circumvention tool
      * Anticircumvention Violation. We also note that the provision or trafficking of the source code violates
      * 17 USC §§1201(a)(2) and 1201(b)(1). The source code is a technology primarily designed or produced for
      * the purpose of, and marketed for, circumventing a technological measure that effectively controls access
      * to copyrighted sound recordings on YouTube, including copyrighted sound recordings owned by our members.

== What DRM ==
* What DRM does youtube have?
  * Uses a rolling cipher
  * Sounds secure
    * It's not though

* Every youtube video is assigned a random string
  * Points to webpage
* When loaded a 2nd URL is generated
  * Through complex changing algorithm
  * Points to video file
    * Known as a rolling cipher
  * no encryption, not obfuscated, 0 protection
* Under US and EU law this is DRM
  * Accessing the URL through unauthorized means is circumventing the DRM

* RIAA has done the same in the past with youtube-mp3
  * https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20160927/17062135646/can-someone-explain-to-riaa-that-sopa-didnt-actually-pass-it-doesnt-seem-to-know-that.shtml


* Interesting part
  * Marketed for, for purpose of

== YTDLs Mistake ==
* Included examples for downloading copyrighted material

* We also note that the source code prominently includes as sample uses of the source
* code the downloading of copies of our members’ copyrighted sound recordings and
* music videos, as noted in Exhibit A hereto. For example, as shown on Exhibit A,
* the source code expressly suggests its use to copy and/or distribute the following
* copyrighted works owned by our member companies:

* This could have been a problem eventually
  * But adding those lines provides strong of RIAA's claim
  * Should have been showing creative commons examples

== Github's Responsibility ==
* Seeing some people angry with GitHub
  * You can have your issue with them
  * In this case have done absolutely nothing wrong
    * Their hands are tied by DMCA 512 safe harbour clause where a platform
    * Must make reasonable attempt at removing infringing content otherwise also be liable for damages
  * GitHub has no responsibility to protect code
  * Can argue whether this law should exist or not
    * But it does and GitHub followed it
    * Is GitHub too big of a target now
      * Probably anything grey would advise moving

== Doesn't Change Anything ==
* YouTube DL still exists
  * Still in python repos
* Already was hosted on other git instances and GitLab
  * Can be host on git instance outside of US law
  * How torrenting sites survive
* RIAA would have to go after every single host individually
  * GitLab main instance is safe until RIAA sends same letter

* DMCA is incredibly wide reaching
  * Due to how streaming video functions
  * Could make case for web browser
    * Falling under same anti-curcumvention violation
      * Nobody is hopefully dumb enough to do so
