* Not intended to provide a unique experience
	* This is effectively a rewrite of Discord in GTK

* Much lighter than official discord
	* About half as much ram
* Claims to be faster
	* Seem about the same on my system
* Uses your GTK3 theme
	* Fits with rest of system

* Some weird design choices
* Rather than showing member list on right side
	* Inside hamburger menu

* Access account info also in hamburger

* Is a problem for fullscreen
	* Designed with floating in mind

* Typing in chat works perfectly
	* Can tag people
	* Can send emotes
		* Emote menu on right
			* Just shows server emotes
		* Emoji accessed from right click menu
	* Can do multi line
	* Can attach files

* Animated server emotes work
	* Along with gifs in chat

* Images open pop up
	* Top left to open in browser
	* No context menu like regular discord

* Switching servers, channels, pm
	* All without problem

* Opening links works perfectly

* Doesn't indicate which servers are NSFW
* Reactions don't work
* Status can't be changed
* No Voice chats
* No server administation outside of bot commands

* If just using discord for text chat actually really awesome tool

* Login done through account token
* Or Discord Login
