* It's 2020 who bothers to learn to program
	* Just get everything you need from stackoverflow

* In reality useful website
	* looking at simple tool to search stackoverflow/exchange unix from terminal
	* Called how2

== General Programming Queries ==
* Let's say you have no idea where to start
	* split a string
		* Prints top result
		* Formatted output colouring anything in programming block
		* Provides link at bottom
			* Visit for more context
	* Result not one you won't
		* Show extra choices with space
		* Enter to show list of comments
			* Orders by number of votes
			* Scroll with arrow or vim keys
			* Open in browser with b or click link
			* Leave with esc
* Some queries too generic for meaningful result

== Language Specific Queries ==
* how2 -l python split a string
* how2 -l c++

* Slight issue
	* c# doesn't seem to function
		* Seems to be an issue with string handling
		* c# is definetly the tag on stackoverflow

== Frameworks/Libraries/Engines ==
* Stackoverflow doesn't distinguish languages from other tags
* how2 -l unity change material
* how2 -l react function
	* Judging by this being -l for language instead of -t for tag
	* Probably isn't intended but is really useful

== General Linux Queries ==
how2 unzip bz2
how2 create a rar
how2 print a file

== Issues ==
* Haven't looked into
	* But I imagine all the sister sites use same API
		* askubuntu
		* mathematica
		* aviation

	* Would be cool to be able to specify stack site
		* query in same way
	* Maybe have extra filters for the different sites
		* or just change -l to a general tag filter
* Old version showed primary tag
	* Made it easier to indentify what you're working with

== Conclusion ==* Sometimes have to tweak search query
	* Relies on stack built in search
	* Things not too complex seems fairly good

* This is an npm application
	* I know a lot of people don't like them
	* I consider a non issue
		* Just install global packages properly
