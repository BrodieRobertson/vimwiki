* A lot of editors come with some sort of indent line
  * For indent based languages like python can be useful
  * Vim plugin indent line

== Demonstration ==
* With my vim settings
  * An indentation happens every 2 characters
  * Based of tab settings
    * Don't understand
    * I'll leave a link down below

== Suggestion ==
* Enable expandtab for easier use
  * Converts tab key into spaces
  * Dev decided to not support tab characters

== Commands ==
* Enable and disable indent line
* Enable and disable leading space
  * Nothing too exciting
  * Mention for completeness

== Configuration ==
* Character anything supported in utf-8
* File Type
:set filetype?

* Buffer Type
:set buftype?

* Buffer name
:echo @%
* Supports globbing

* Concealcursor, conseallevel help

== Issues ==
* It's rare to not have any issues
  * It does everything it claims to do
