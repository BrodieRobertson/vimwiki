* Text editor written in bash
* Well what exactly is the point
	* Proof of concept than a good editor
		* See what I mean
		* Only 230 lines of bash script

* First open, looks like any terminal editor
	* A bit funky to work with but it's interesting
	* Modal editor

	* i insert line and edit
	* b insert a new line
	* e to edit line
		* Invisble cursor
	* a append to line
	* enter to end line

	* arrow keys to move

	* c delete contents
	* d delete line
		* Delete line 0

	* w write to file
	* f set target file
	* q to quit

	* l to load in file

* Editor released less than 2 weeks ago
	* Much much better/complete options
	* Parts of vim and emacs you like
	* What it shows is that building a text editor is very possible
	* Maybe vim isn't perfect/maybe emacs isn't
	* You have programming talent
	* Well just make something yourself
		* It can be configured exactly the way you want
	* Great thing about programming
		* Make thing yourself
