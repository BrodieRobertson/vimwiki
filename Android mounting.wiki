* Connected via USB
* MTP needs to be enabled on the device
* Device must be unlocked
	* Wasn't the case on older devices
	* Massive security whole
	* Would allow file transfers on locked devices

* Simple-mtpfs
* Fusermount
	* Comes from fuse2
	* Dependency of first

* Simplest method
	* Allows for mounting multiple devices at once with no challenge

* MTP
	* Media Transfer Protocol
	* Method to transfer media files from portable devices
	* Extension of PTP
	* Photo transfer protocol

* Making use of a system called FUSE
	* File system in Userspace
	* Userspace meaning non privileged users
		* Not root
	* Execute file system as regular user
		* Kernal module running in the background acts as bridge
	* Without FUSE or equivalent would require root
	* Might do a proper video on it

* A bunch of options we don't care about
	* Mainly FUSE settings
* simple-mtpfs -l lists devices
	* Says oppo actually realme

* Also need a place to mount
	* Anywhere you have user access to
	* I like ~/cell

* To actually mount
	* simple-mtpfs --device id mount
	* As long as initally requirements met you're half done
	* Feel free to transfer files

* What if we unplug
	* Folders still here?
	* File system still exists

* Need to unmount
	* fusermount
	* Can't be too damaging it's just FUSE
	* fusermount -u mount

* All that is too much writing
	* Stick it in a script
	* Or use mine
