* package
	* PKGBUILD downloads the latest stable source code
	* Compiles it, arranges the files and creates a package

* package-git
	* Similiar but downloads latest version from the git repo
	* All new features
	* May lead to the application being unstable
	* Depends on how the project is structured
	* Still will get compiled and built

* package-bin
	* Downloads a precompiled binary
	* Generally just a deb package
	* Not always the case but ubuntu is fairly popular
	* Arranges the the files for suitability with arch
	* Generates the package

* package-git-bin
	* Downloads a precompiled binary of latest build
	* Generally doesn't happen
	* No point making a binary of an unstable build

Bin vs stable/git

* Generally web browsers you should download bin
* Typically massive pieces of software
* Brave is a good example
	* I have brave-bin installed
	* Fucks knows how long compile time

* Can edit the source code of stable/git releases
* Enable features that were disabled for compatibility

* Suckless utils
	* Probably shouldn't use AUR package
	* Intended to be modified

* Install from the aur or standard repo
	* Not much of a difference
	* Generally should use standard repos
