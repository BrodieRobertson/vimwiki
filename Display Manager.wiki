* I see so many people talk about display managers
  * As if they're something you actually need

* From what I've seen they cause more problems than they solve

== Alternate Solution ==
* xorg-xinit

* Define xinitrc
  * Style is very similar to your xprofile
    * Used for things like lightdm or gddm display manager

* With one extra line included
  * exec Name_of_enviroment
* In many cases just the name of the package
  * window managers
* Desktop enviroments can also be started like this
  * Be sure to check the name
  * gnome is gnome-session

* Should just be used to launch programs that rely on X
  * I have a bad habit of using it for general auto start
  * Other things make more sense in .profile/bash_profile/zprofile
    * Only drawback is longer to start X
      * Try and keep as light as possible
* Anything that relies on your enviroment
  * Launch in environment auto launcher

* You can just run startx
  * Your display manager is basically doing something similiar
* Xorg-xinit also comes with xinit
  * Startx is just a front end for it
    * Makes it a bit easier to use
    * Most of the time startx will be fine to use

* Display manager make it slightly easier to use multiple environments
  * But still not required
  * startx accepts an argument

* Autolaunch environment
  * I'm tool lazy to write startx
  * And I run 1 environment
  * Show zprofile

* But you could still give yourself a simple interface
  * Just prompt the user for input
  * Take the input to select which environment to launch
    * I might go do that

== Merits of Display Manager ==
* I get it display managers look cool
  * It is nice to have a fancy looking interfaces
* I'm running a grub theme
  * But I need boot loader to launch my system
  * Might as well make it look good
* But I don't need this
  * And I'm only going to see it at most once a day

== Probably Fine Most Of The Time ==
* But occasionally
  * A new nvidia driver isn't compatible
  * The x server won't start due to some weird incompatibility

* They add an extra failure point
  * For not much of a benefit in my eyes
  * Feel free to run what you want though
