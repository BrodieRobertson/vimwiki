* Heard the vi is installed everywhere

* Learning curve is steep but rewarding
	* Getting productive in vim takes a while
	* Don't do it when you're busy with assignments
* Modal editing
	* Might counterintuitve at first
	* Why do I need to switch modes
	* Too used to using a mouse in a text editor
	* Clear seperation allows for more things to be bound
		* Insert mode
			* Snippets
		* Normal mode
			* Movement, Removal of text, pasting
		* Command mode
			* Access to all commands
		* Visual mode
			* Selections
	* Without modal editing everything needs a modifier
		* Less comfortable
* Keybindings might seem odd but generally make sense
	* gg go to start of file
	* dd delete from start of line
	* yy yank from start of line
	* cc change from start of line

	* G go to end of file
	* D delete to end of line
	* C change to end of line
	* Y historical inconsistency

	* o new line above
	* O new line below
	* p paste line above
	* P paste line below
* Endlessly learning new things
	* Tabs
	* Terminal
	* Not even considering plugins
* Massive plugin environment
	* From incredibly useful like emmet, vimwiki
	* To indredibly niche like countless plugins for frameworks
	* Sites dedicated to vim plugins
		* Vim awesome
	* Always new things being made
* Every action is bound to a key
	* Generally multiple
* Work however you want
	* Sometimes I use the mouse
		* Not as much because scroll wheel broken
	* Don't need model editing
		* Rebind everything
* Vim keys outside of vim
	* Vimium/vimperator/other vim plugins
	* Qute/Surf browser
	* ZSH, Bash Fish
	* lf, ranger, nnn, vifm
	* Sc-im
	* A lot of terminal apps

* Why not just use vscodium + vim emulation
	* Vim is more than just vim keys
	* Plugins make up a big part of why I use vim

* What about emacs
	* Same monolithic learning task as vim
	* Going back to square one
	* Maybe one day, but for now I'm happy where I am
