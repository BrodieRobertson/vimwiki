* Someone wanted a video so here we go
	* Today is just getting a setup working

* Something in sample config I missed
	* Breaks everything

* Config
	* .mpdconf
	* ~/.config/mpd/mpd.conf

* mpd
	* music_directory
		* Where music is stored
	* db_file
		* stores info about music for quick access
	* pid_file
		* stores the mpd id
		* Probably won't need, good to have
	* state_file
		* Restores mpd state
	* playlist_directory
		* Where to store playlists
	* sticker_file
		* Stores dynamic information
	* All should be in .local/share

* I would suggest enabling auto update
	* If not
		* Can be updated with u in ncmpcpp
		* mpc update

* If using port 6600
	* use port

* follow_inside_symlinks
* follow_outside_symlinks
	* Defaults to true

* Supposedly mpd requires configuration for pulse
	* I didn't
		* Can't comment on other systems

* Client
	* I'll do some dedicated videos
	* Generally people go with ncmpcpp for the terminal
	* But there are plenty of gui options
	* Or just use cli mpc

* Media keys
	* Tools built for MPD
	* I like PlayerCTL
		* Generic
	* MPD doesn't support it

* mpDris2
	* Unless you've configured port
		* Just run

* playerctl play-pause
	* next
	* previous
	* stop
	* Any others check manual
	* Being generic browser is also supported
		* Specify player with --player
	* Will do a video soon

* If you want easiest solution
	* Have mpd and mpDris2 autostart
		* xinitrc or systemd job
