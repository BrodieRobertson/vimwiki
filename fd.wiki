== Intro ==
* Find is great not the most performant implementation
	* I know rust rewrites are a meme
	* Fd is objectively better for most use cases

== Demo ==

* fd nvim

* Case Insensitive unless including capital in search
* fd NvIm

* Regex not globbing
	* fd "p.*cast"

* By default doesn't include hidden files/dirs
	* Respects ignore files
	* Doesn't follow symlinks

* include hidden -H
* include ignored files -I
	* -u no-ignore -uu bot
	* Unclear
* --no-ignore-vcs only ignores .gitnores

* Case insensitive -s
* Case sensitive -i

* Switch to globbing -g

* Switch to fixed string -F
	* If full word or contains word

* -l ls -l like output

* --max-reslts quit after count

* Limit results by file size -S
	* + great than
	* - less than
	* num
	* Unit

* -t only include type

== Practical Use ==

* Check word counts in folder
fd -t f -x wc -l

* Take first 10 results and put them in a selector
fd --max-results 10 | fzf

== Benchmark ==
find ~ -iregex '.*[0-9]\.jpg$'

* Globs are much quicker
find ~ -iname '*[0-9].jpg'

* Make it fair by traversing hidden and ignoring gitignores
fd -HI '.*[0-9]\.jpg$' ~
fd '[0-9]\.jpg$' ~

* Didn't bother with exact numbers
	* fd is noticably quicker
	* Seem to follow same trend as github results

== Final Thoughts ==
* Some edge cases may not be covered by this app
	* Doesn't include every option of find
	* But for what most people use it for
	* Hands down a better app

* Didn't include all options
	* Plenty more especially in filtering to have a look through

* If you need find like capabilities
	* Would highly recommend
