== Uni Almost Over ==
* As of recording 26/27th of October
* 3ish weeks remaining
  * End of degree, been a long journey
  * No idea whether it'll be used or not
  * Wanted to get it done though

* Every single day working on assignments
  * 3 classes
    * Big Data Basics
      * Paper basically done
      * Presentation need to start
      * Final prac test
    * VR
      * 3rd assignment need to start
      * Paper review nearly done
        * Need to present
    * Honors
      * Paper need to start writing
        * Research done
      * 100 page design needs to be edited

  * Reading research papers every day super draining
  * If all goes well should be done early
    * Fingers crossed

== Quality Drop ==
* I don't know if it's just me being paranoid
  * Spending too much time looking for problems
* Feel like there's been a quality drop
  * Positive reception
  * Continue in this direction
* But I'm not as happy with them
  * Not as much time to prepare videos
    * Test software, write notes, not as much energy effects delivery
    * Do background research on issues

* As well as video variety

== Certain Videos Not Feasible Right Now ==
* Want some more Unix history
  * Don't have time to sit down and research
* Tutorial content
  * Usually do it on something I want myself
  * No time to mess around with Linux right now

== Not Stressed ==
* If wanted to could stop working now
  * Still probably pass
  * Not certain
    * Haven't done the maths
  * I think I'm sitting above 90% in everything right now
    * Just smash out a baseline assignment it'll be fine

== Not Getting Out Much ==
* Been inside way too much recently
  * Only get out to go to work
  * Suns not out
    * Probably doesn't help in the matter
  * Do keep curtains open though
    * Working in darkness probably awful idea

== Don't Worry About My Sleep ==
* Unlike some I'm taking sleep seriously
  * I've made mistakes in previous years
  * During my C++ course
    * Worked on assignment from 10am - 7am
    * Wouldn't recommend
* Not getting out much probably leads to worse sleep though
  * I need to find some time to change that

== What's Different Now ==
* Been through 3 semesters + youtube

* Final semester is always a lot of work
  * But I'm effectively working 2 jobs
  * Super market 10 hours a week
  * No idea how long I spend on YouTube
    * Fair to say at 35 hours
    * Growing
      * More time on prep, titles, thumbnails


* To be honest making videos is the most fun I'm having
  * Even though it's absorbing all my time
  * It's something I enjoy
  * Just a quick update on me
