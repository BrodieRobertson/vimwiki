= Text Formatters =

* Formatting is seperate from the text
	* Some more so than others
	* Latex is in a cls file
	* Troff your macros define a layout of sorts
* Files get out of date
* No fighting with changes to the editor
* Use whatever editor you want
	*	No need to learn new mappings
	* If it's vim you can add your own
* Build your custom tool chains
	* Pandoc, filters
	* Troff, txt2tags, ctags
	* Math processor
	* Graphing processor
* Convert to other formats with tools like pandoc
* Convert to output formatts like pdf, epub, etc.

* Obviously some drawbacks
* Unless all using markdown, or all using latex
	* Collaboration goes out the window
	* Can be done just a bit finicky
* If you're not used to working in plain text will be a bit confusing
* Have to remember text commands
	*	Can be eleviated with a good editor
