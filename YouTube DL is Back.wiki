* put platforms like GitHub and developers in a difficult spot
  * This is talking about safe harbour
    * Whereby a platform must make a reasonable attempt
    * To remove infringing content
      * Otherwise also be liable for damages

* Rest of the post is a FAQ

== Why did GitHub process this takedown in the first place? ==
https://github.com/github/dmca
* But this is exceedingly rare.
  * All GitHub DMCA takedown notices are public
    * You'll see a lot of software cracks
    * A common one I see if for the JetBrains suite
  * But even more so rehosting non open code
    * And books
* growing, industry-wide issue for developers with far-reaching implications.
  * RIAA has been taking notice of Twitch lately
    * So it seems like they're finally going after people

== Circumvention claims under the DMCA ==
* In short
  * Nothing like YouTube-dl existed in the 90's
  * Especially something with legal uses cases
    * Like archiving creative commons media

== GitHub’s developer-focused approach to the DMCA ==
* DMCA takedown notices to comply with the law
  * Any that don't
    * Operate outside the US or EU
    * Or are waiting to be sued

* These points go beyond they're legal requirements

== Youtube-dl ==
We also understood that this project’s code has many legitimate purposes, including changing playback speeds for accessibility, preserving evidence in the fight for human rights, aiding journalists in fact-checking, and downloading Creative Commons-licensed or public domain videos.

== What we’re changing ==
* Github claims they'll be making some changes
  * Can't say the effect until another big DMCA scare

== Developer defense fund ==
* Legal advice from Software Freedom Law center and the Electronic Frontier Foundation
  * Problem is that this doesn't help fund legal

* This is quite a nice gesture
  * Especially small open source teams
    * Can't really even afford to pay developers
* Establish Developer defense fund
  * 1M donation
* To help protect open source developers on GitHub from unwarranted DMCA
  * Section 1201 takedown claims.

== How we’re working to improve the law ==

== Closing ==
* It's nice to see github make some changes
  * I stand by my original point though
  * If you're doing anything remotely sketchy
    * Don't use github, they're too obvious of a target
