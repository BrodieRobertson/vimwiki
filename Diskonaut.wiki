* Visual disk usage analyzer/navigator
	* For the terminal

* No argument start from current folder
	* Or pass in starting point

* Starts by showing largest element
	* And a number of others relative to size
	* For example

* Shows size
* Shows descendants
	* Sort is entirely basied on size

* Zoom in and out to show different sized files
	* Zooming in shows less of larger files
	* Stays in same directory

* Might notice cursor
	* Move around with arrow keys
	* Or vim keys

* Enter to enter folder
	* Now we see picture descendants
	* Can't open files
		* Not a file manager
		* Would be cool

* Go up level with esc
* Delete file with backspace
	* Shows freed space in top bar

* Is it super practical
	* Maybe not
	* Could always use du
		* ncdu
		* Or any other disk analyzer
	* Does give a good visual representation
	* Besides having a different interface it doesn't do job worse
