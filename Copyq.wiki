* Most complete useful clipboard manager

* Supports arbitrary image sizes

* Comes with a GUI
* Scripting interface

* Run copyq as a daemon
	* Icon in system tray, can be hidden

* If hidden can be shown with copyq toggle

* Or bring up context menu
	* copyq menu

* Syntax highlighting

* Tags
	* Mark an item as being important
	* No easy cli command
copyq write text/plain "Item with tag" application/x-copyq-tags "Some tag text"
		* Without scripting api just aesthetic

* Everything from CLI can be done on GUI
