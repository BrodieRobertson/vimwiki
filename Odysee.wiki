 Haven't talked about LBRY in a while
	* Been through a lot of changes since then
	* On Desktop and LBRY tv
	* But now we have Odysee

* First thing is new colour scheme
	* Defaults dark theme, always nice
		* More of a purple hue
	* New layout, making use of entire screen
		* Been asking for this for months

* Second notifications
	* Been waiting so long for this
	* Only show comment notification
		* I don't need subscription or like notifications
	* Super important for 2 reasons
		* 1 I as a creator can see when you comment
		* 2 You as a viewer can see when I respond
			* Encourages more conversation

* Recommendation system way better
	* Sometimes basically perfect
		* Goneovim
		* The quartering
	* Sometimes still falls apart
		* Untapped magic

* Still no quality controls
	* Hopefully coming soon
	* But even so it's much faster

* Like and dislike
	* Don't effect algorithm at this point

* A lot of creators are on LBRY
	* Obviously lot's of crypto channels,
		* Naomi Brokwell, Crypto lark
	* Electronics - EEVBlog, Big Clive, Louis Rossman
	* Quartering, Sargon, David Pakman, Tim Pool, Zuby for politics
	* Tons of Linux creators, HexDSL, Luke, DT, Lunduke, TLG,
		* Linux Experiment, DestinationLinux
	* Epos Vox, Big Boss, ScammerRevolts

* Wallet remains basically unchanged from app
	* Creator wallets are massive, slower than yours
		* Quicker than it was
	* Filtering by type

* Left hand tabs
	* Basically tag shortcuts
		* Right now seem a bit arbitrary
	* Tech, gaming, lab, news, finance 2.0 cool
	* Enlightenment, rabbit hole

* Improved uploader
	* Tool tips on everything
	* Thumbnail uploading finally works properly
	* Still quicker to just use external service

* Sync new channel button
	* Been waiting for this for months

* Nothing really changed in account settings
* Creator analytics still needs a lot of work

* Desktop app matches LBRY tv
