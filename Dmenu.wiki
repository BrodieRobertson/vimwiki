* Dmenu is one of the suckless program I still actively use
  * There's a few other suggested tools
  * Like xbanish but only one listed as a suckless tool
    * st is installed for when Alacritty breaks though

* Wanted to talk about
  * Why I've stuck with dmenu

== Patches ==
* Patching is one of those super annoying things about suckless utils
* Unlike other tools
  * Dmenu is perfectly usable without
    * Infact I didn't bother patching for some months

* Most dmenu patches I've added are aesthetic
  * In fact in general most are

* I've added in highlight
  * Visually show what you're matched on

* Line height was a really important one for me
  * My poylbar is higher than dmenus default height
    * Looked a bit weird

* Numbers
  * Shows how many results there are
    * how many match on query

* Custom colour scheme patch
  * So if you want it
  * It's on my github

* One feature patch
  * Instant
    * If there's only 1 result just select it
    * No need to show prompt

== Functional Patches To Note ==

https://tools.suckless.org/dmenu/patches/incremental/

== Fits Into A Window Manager ==
* I could do what I do with most tools
  * I run a window manager
  * Do a lot of terminal stuff
    * Typically like lightweight simple tools
      * Dmenu is exactly that

== Speed ==
* The biggest list of data I use is about 3700 items
  * My app launcher
  * Absolutely no noticable performance dip
    * Even on my laptop
  * That's not to say it's magic
    * It might lag with 1,000,000
      * But for realistic use cases it's lightning fast

== Installation ==
* Since it's usable without patching
  * It's sensible to install with your package manager
* You will be dissapointed with st if you did that

== Compatibility ==
* Doesn't require special input
  * Just takes new line seperated list
  * Can switch to fzf or rofi without touching my scripts
* I heavily use dmenu in scripts
  * Basically any time I need a choice
  * Key bindings would be quicker
    * I only have so many keys

== Rofi ==
* Rofi is probably amazing
  * I've seen some crazy custom themes
  * Where it's not even the same app anymore
* But out of the box it looks awful
  * Getting it to the point where it looks good
  * Takes a bit of time
* I can slap dmenu on a new system and be happy

* If you're happy on rofi
  * I couldn't convince you to use dmenu
  * But if you're looking for a light launcher dmenu is great choice

* I'm not going to talk about topic
  * Mental Outlaw did a video on, I don't actually care
