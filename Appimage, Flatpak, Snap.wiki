* Flatpaks, AppImages and Snaps are the 3 major universal packaging systems
	* Each covered separately linked down below

* Not intended to start a fight but I know it will
	* Please be civil in the comments

== Low Level Packages ==
* Probably don't want to do it
	* Snaps used to package pulse audio,

== Each Have Very Different Goals ==
* Surface level same job
	* Different project goals
	* Not generally considered

* I like to imagine a spectrum
	* Snaps try to embrace everything, if you have snap tools entire system is snaps
		* Snap kernel https://snapcraft.io/pi2-kernel
		* System snaps https://snapcraft.io/pulseaudio
	* Flatpak addresses inconsistent dependencies
		* Different names or missing dependencies
		* Maintaining package management
	* AppImage self contained bundle no outside dependency
		* Besides generic FUSE install
			* 3rd party package managers do exist

== History ==
* Interestingly AppImages have been around the longest
* Snap originally released in 2014
* Flatpak originally released in 2015
* AppImage name started being used in 2013
	* Existed under names like klik and portable linux apps since 2004

== Corporate Backing ==
* Both Flatpak and Snaps and corporate backed
	* Snaps well known as a Canonical project
	* Flatpak is a RedHat funded project
	* As for AppImage actual community project
		* Partially why it's existed for 16 years and isn't at the top
		* Funding is important and you might consider it important where it comes from
		* Personally I care about the end result

== Tooling ==
* The biggest issue with using snaps is tool access
	* A lot of distros don't include in main repos
	* But even when they do in the case of flatpak
	* Every done through flatpak tools
	* Does comes with package manager advantages
		* Not as simple as AppImage
		* Tooling on user side is generic
		* Just need a working FUSE installation
			* Probably have installed if you've used any mtpfs tool

* AppImages don't require any root access or any special install process
	* As easy to install as a shell script
		* Make executable and done

* .snap and .flatpakref useless without tools
	* But once installed don't require root access

== Package Distribution ==
* Whilst all 3 have there own "stores"
	* AppimageHub just a Github io list

* AppImages generally distributed from devs website
* Flathub is the primary store but alternatives do exist
* Snaps on the other hand lock you to the snap store
	* Which while user and dev tooling is open source this is not

== Security ==
* Both Snaps and Flatpaks attempt to do sandboxing
	* Snaps are locked to AppArmor, Flatpaks to bubblewrap
		* Can be disabled for snaps and has flaws in flatpak
			* link down below
	* AppImages don't sandbox
		* Can be sandboxed by user, complete freedom

== My Favourite ==
* Try to install packages natively when possible
	* If for whatever reason need to use
	* I go with App Image

	* Very likely already have working FUSE installation
		* Dependency for a lot of apps
		* Leading to the meme status of "It Just Works"

* There may be things I didn't cover
	* Let me know down below
