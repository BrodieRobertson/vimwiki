* Learning experience
* Not directed at people looking to get work done now
* Ricers and people who want to learn about linux

* ZSH/Fish
* But they're a trap for new users
* The Oh my ZSH problem
* It's a glorified config file
* Most plugins are just aliases
* The ones that aren't take one line to get working
* Oh My ZSH obfuscates

* A recent comment asking about my zsh theme

* Coming from bash you spot this
* You can install it if you want
* But you don't have to
* Bash gives you experience to notice this

* Everything that oh my zsh calls a plugin
* You have already done as a script or function or alias

* ZSH completion is amazing
	* Can be even better, script to intellisense style completion
* But you need to suffer a bit
	* Some value in writing out more
	* And it not being as easy

* Talk about Fish for moment
	* Not a POSIX shell
	* You may see as a good thing
	* A lot of scripts are POSIX compliant
	* Being able to understand it is helpful
