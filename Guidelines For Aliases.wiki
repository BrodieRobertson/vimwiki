* My guidelines for setting aliases

* Firstly short
	* For obvious reasons
	* Too long hard to remember
	* Difficult to type
	* May not provide much value

* Try keep to 1 letter per word
	* May not produce the shortest aliases
	* Easy to remember
	* Deals with conflicts
	* Transmission-remote-cli tremc which should be 1 char
	* For same length same letters
	* I change both

* Ok to alias rarely used programs if easy to remember
	* m to mpv

* Alias categories
	* Git commands all start with g
	* Cd commands all start with c
	* Now for coloured output
	* Angular commands all start with n
	* Much easier to remember

* Typically avoid aliasing every variation
	* Aliasing option combinations
	* Snowballs incredibly quickly
	* Make one exception and that's git
	* I know which git commands are useful
	* Don't alias git config, cherry-pick other ones not commonly used
	* push, diff, pull, add, commit, status
	* Saves key presses
	* Ok to do sometimes
	* Too much becomes hard
