* There seems to exist only 1 other exit percent speedrun
* But this mans strats had fundamental flaws
* I think we can do better

* Relying the help page will severely slow your PB
  * I think we can optimize this

* By using his web browser
  * He introduced some RNG in the run that I don't think we need
  * I'm pretty sure my strat will avoid this

* He's also gone and made a few mistakes with typing with typing help
  * And accidentally running shell commands

* And judging by the end he's actually an emacs user
  * I've got 2 years of experience

== Run ==
* The time to beat is 2:50.13
  * I think we can just scrape by with the world record

* Go

* I forgot the time we needed to hit
  * Check time
  * We've demolished the world record by over 2:48 seconds

* That's a world record
  * I've been training for months for this
  * I can't believe it's finally happened

* Thank you to everyone who has supported me
  * Before I go I'd like to say one thing

== Outro ==
* This video is 100% serious...
