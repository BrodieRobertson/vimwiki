* X applications have a bad habit of wiping clipboard
	* Intended behaviour but really annoying
* Provides a method to access older copied text

* Client server model
	* Clipmenud is the server daemon
	* Clipmenu is the client to select with

* Demonstration

* Recommend launching clipmenud in something like xinitrc
* Clipmenu should be on a key binding

* Clipmenu passes all options through

* Configuration done through enviroment variables

* Visible History length $CM_HISTLENGTH
* Max clips $CM_MAX_CLIPS
	* Default 1000
* Launcher $CM_LAUNCHER
	* fzf
	* rofi
	* rofi script
	* Anything similiar enough to dmenu should work
* Stdout $CM_OUTPUT_CLIP
* Clipboards $CM_SELECTIONS
	* Defaults to primary and clipboard
* Defeats the purpose $CM_ONESHOT
* Ignore certain windows with regex $CM_IGNORE_WINDOW
	* Matches on windowname
* debug mode $CM_ONESHOT

* If you don't want to store something
	* Seperate script
	* clipctl disable

* Modify clipboard with clipdel
	* Just lists changes by default
	* -d to perform deletion
	* Let's you test regex

* Also a clipfsck
	* Not sure what it's supposed to do

* Slight annoyance
	* dmenu is optional but it's package makes it dependency
	* I run a fork of dmenu
		* Should switch to manual install

* I've been thinking about trying this for a long time
	* You have no idea how many times I've reopened windows
	* Due to clipboard problem
