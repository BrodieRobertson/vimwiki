* Assumptions about linux power users
	* Me and others
	* Partially because of the popular ones on YouTube
	* Not all are like this, Chris Titus, Lunduke, TLG
	* But DT and Luke are popular example

* Terminal applications
	* Use extremely frequently
	* Show a lot on the channel
		* Perform well
		* I think they're fun to play with
	* Don't handy cap myself
	* Sometimes a GUI is way better
	* FFmpeg for example
		* Could use it
		* Way more annoying for me to use than Kdenlive
	* GUI text editor makes less sense
		* For code maybe there's a reason for it
		* But general writing no

* Vim
	* Use it for most things
	* Advocate it's use
	* Shell script, general writing, web dev
	* But for C, Java, etc.
	* I will use an IDE
		* Can setup it up for those
		* Rarely write those languages
		* IDE is just easier
	* It might seem counterintuitive
		* If I did C a lot I would setup vim
		* But I don't
	* Just take the easy option sometimes

* Tiling WM
	* I like tiling WM
	* They are objectively better
		* Entire video about this
	* Feel free to use whatever you want though
	* I think it's a better choice
		* Will encourage people
		* Do what you want on your system

* Open Source Software
	* I generally use open source software
	* Recently did a video talking about my stance
		* tldr is software pragmatism
			* Best tool for the job
	* Assumed must be diehard open source supporter
		* Do support but not against propertiaty software
		* Especially the case because of my channel origin
	* Sometimes good open source tool doesn't exist
		* Then I use the propertiary one
		* Don't want to handycap myself

* System Resources
	* Don't want to pointlessly waste resources
	* Have powerful PC
	* Can produce whatever experience I want
	* Hard drive space isn't a precious resource
	* That's why I like Nativefier
		* Is it efficient, absolutely not
		* Do I like it, absolutely
	* CPU a bit more precious
		* Video renders
		* If I need it all I do is kill the application using it
		* But when not rendering I can use it for other things
			* Hiding windows, expensive web browser, etc
		* Why would I just let it sit there
