* Final 3 of the Linux Universal packaging systems

* Developed by Free Desktop
	* A lot of people get caught up in canonical controversy
	* Blinds them from actual software
	* Not like this is a purely community project
		* Backing from Redhat and Endless
		* Seems much more community oriented

* Much more similar to snaps
	* Using a package manager, distributing from a store
	* With the main store being flathub
		* Mainly comparisons to those

* Much more widespread support
	* Some distros are supported out of the box
		* Unlike snaps tools in many distros standard repos
	* But not as many apps
		* Not as much of an issue as it might sound
			* Because a lot of programs are garbage
			* Things like Spotify, GIMP, libre office are here

* Like with snaps requires flatpak tools to run and install
	* Even if you download install file
		* Still need internet to install the application

* When it comes to updates
	* Not done automatically, all down through package manager
	* Some extra tools do auto query for updates though

* Sandboxing isn't optional in this case
	* Holes can be poked in it but it cannot be removed
	* If security is important may be of interest
		* Makes use of Bubblewrap for sandboxing
			* I'm no security expert, couldn't give you the merits over firejail or AppArmor

* Not locked into a single store
	* Flathub seems fine, but if you want to switch nothing stopping you
	* Gives users and developers more freedom to find apps

* Unlike a certain other packaging system
	* Doesn't spam system with loopback devices, always a nice plus
		* Can be unistalled without leaving an annoying trail of destruction

* When it comes to performance
	* I don't notice any issues myself
	* If you ask if flatpaks are better than the alternatives
		* Much harder to answer
		* From my research
		* Seems to be down to the app, the computer, the version, the moon phase
	* My suggestion is experiment for yourself
		* See what works best on your system

* Install flatpaks is very straight forward
	* Come to website
		* Nicely broken down for popular distros
		* I'm on Arch
			* Install flatpak package
			* Do a reboot
		* flatpak search NAME
		* flatpak install NAME
		* flatpak uninstall NAME
			* Clean up runtimes
			* flatpak uninstall --unused

* Still a work in progress not having hit version 1.0.0 yet
	* However there's been a lot of work made on this project

* It's fair to say that Snaps and Flatpaks work in a similiar way
	* Flatpak leans more towards the open side
		* Not relyin on proprietary store
