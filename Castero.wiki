* Obviously you could always just use a RSS feed reader
	* Newsboat
	* But maybe it's nice to have a dedicated tool for podcasts

* Today we're looking at a tool called castero
	* Pretty barebones TUI podcasting tool

* Highly reccomend changing initial keys
	* Has vim keys in a weird way
	* Not movement

* First thing add some feeds
	* Done inside the app
	* a by default
	* d for delete
		* Won't confirm by default

* Will download straight away
	* Reload with r

* i to invert order

* Enter to start playing episode
* p for play/pause
* q will add to q
* n to skip forward in the queue
* c to clear queue

* 1 - 4 changes interface
	* 1 main interface, feeds, episodes, meta
	* 2 queue, metadata
	* 3 Feeds, episodes
		* No meta data
	* 4 downloaded episodes

* Enter on something later in queue breaks it

* Filtering
* /
	* By number works
	* Don't ever use capitals

* f for forward
* b for backward
* ] increase speed
* [ decrease speed

* Configuration
	* When installed you get a massive default config
	* Really well documented

* When feeds are loading app temporarily locks up

* Doesn't save last listening point

* Severly slows down with big feeds

* Crashes if adding a new feed during reload
