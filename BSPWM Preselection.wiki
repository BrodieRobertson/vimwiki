* Receptacles are great for moving around pre-existing windows
  * But what about automatically handling new windows

* That's where we can use preselection
  * We'll look at the technicals in a bit but for now

== Usage ==
* By default bspwm uses a predefined insertion order
  * I use alternate
    * Yours may be different
  * Great most of the time but has it's limitations

presel-dir
* Takes in a cardinal direction
  * Creates a colored block to indicate direction
* Make window takes that spot
presel-dir cancel will close that presel
presel-dir ~DIR matches current presel
  * Treated as a canel

presel-ratio
* This is a floating point between 0 and 1

* How much of the current window should be new window
  * It's a percentage

* Can be used without presel-dir
  * Uses normal splitting direction

* But makes more sense when combined

* presel_feedback_color
  * Color of preselection area

== What's Actually Happening ==
* Bspwm is a binary tree
  * But it doesn't split as you might think

* Demonstrate in GIMP

* So if we wanted to change ratio
  * -r

* Presel is basically a temporary node
  * That acts like a split
  * So you can specify it's ratio and direction

== Aren't These Just Receptacles ==
* With blue boxes
* They're very similiar
  * Produce same result in a lot of use cases

* Presel effect newly created nodes
  * Regardless of user intervention

* Receptacles require user intervention
  * And can be used for existing nodes
  * Obviously with a script to automate
    * Can add new windows straight into receptacle

* You can access receptacles through
  * Node add event
    * Filter out other node events
* Presel have dedicated event
  * node_presel

== My thoughts ==
* Because I haven't automated anything
  * I find receptacles to be much more powerful
* Both open up bspwm to custom layouts
  * And manual tiling
