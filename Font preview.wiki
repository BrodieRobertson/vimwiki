 It's pretty easy to forget what your fonts look like
	* So here's simple script to preview them
	* Called font preview

* Run on font path
	* Takes user and system fonts

* Or pass in path to font with
	* -i

* No need to close preview
	* Selecting new font switches image

* --preview-text
	* Default text is english centric
		* Check other languages

	* Need to see what a heading on a website would look like
	* Combine with --bg-color
		* Name, hex, gray()rgb(r, g, b), hsb(120, 100%,  100%), hsl(120, 100%,  100%)
			* cielab(62.253188, 23.950124, 48.410653)
			* Check the imagemagick docs for a full list

* --size to change the preview window
	* No indication of how it works
* --position change position
	* +0+0
	* Don't function properly in a tiling context
		* Expected to happen

# Input prompt of fuzzy searcher
export FONTPREVIEW_SEARCH_PROMPT="❯ "

# Size of the font preview window
export FONTPREVIEW_SIZE=532x365

# The position where the font preview window should be displayed
export FONTPREVIEW_POSITION="+0+0"

# Font size
export FONTPREVIEW_FONT_SIZE=38

# Background color of the font preview window
export FONTPREVIEW_BG_COLOR="#ffffff"

# Foreground color of the font preview window
export FONTPREVIEW_FG_COLOR="#000000"

# Preview text that should be displayed in the font preview window
export FONTPREVIEW_PREVIEW_TEXT="ABCDEFGHIJKLM\nNOPQRSTUVWXYZ\nabcdefghijklm\nnopqrstuvwxyz\n1234567890\n!@$\%(){}[]"

* Use for any long term settings
	* Maybe English isn't your primary language and you want default to be another language

* Doesn't work with color emoji
😀 😃 😄 😁 😆 😅 😂 🤣
	* One of the reasons I would consider using this
	* Claims to be an issue with SXIV
		* Nonsense, it's an image by the time it gets there
	* Wider characters cause a lot of issues, but you can preview nerd fonts

* Dependencies
xdotool
fzf
imagemagick
sxiv

* Dependency on sxiv not an issue for me since I use it
	* Since it's just a shell script easy to change
	* Same with fzf as well
		* I can't see why they're not configurable
