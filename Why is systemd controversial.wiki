* Once your kernel is loaded into memory
* It launches an init system this the PID 1
* Every other process is directly or indirectly launched by it

* Main concern is it does too much
* Systemd is more than just an init system
	* Currently a suite of ~70 applications most of which have nothing to do with init
		* logind manages user logins
		* tmpfiles manages tmp files
		* networkd manages network devices
		* homed manages portable user accounts
	* Everything systemd does can already be done with other software

* Some simply dislike those who steer the project
	* Red hat project
	* They get to control the direction of the defautl init system
	* Have an indirect hand in most distros
	* Same issue people have with Chromium
	* Semi serious comments about Red Hat trying to seize the Linux kernel
		* Waiting for systemd-kerneld

* Provides more oppurtunities for bugs
	* Compared to runit, or systemv-init, systemd is massive
	* Obviously has a lot of maintainers
	* Larger code bases more succeptable to bugs

* Distros blindly accepting systemd
	* Not true at least in the case of debian
	* https://www.debian.org/vote/2014/vote_003
	* Most maintainers probably take the job a bit more seriously

* Generally no choice of init system
	* Some exceptions Artix being one
	* Most of the time stuck with whatever distro maintainers pick
	* Feel like systemd to aggregiously rejects Unix philosophy to use distro
	* Can be replaced
		* unless you're on Gnome which depends on it
		* Not the easiest thing to do in most cases

* If you're not already thinking about your init should care
	* Not really
	* It'll always be around in the background
	* If it's not an issue for you don't worry about it
		* Most init system are faster
	* Fundamentally a hardcore linux problem

* The alternatives
* Runit
* Upstart
* OpenRC
* S6-linux-init
	* Intended to replace System V init
	* Prior to systemd was the default option

* If you don't like systemd let me know if I'm completely wrong
