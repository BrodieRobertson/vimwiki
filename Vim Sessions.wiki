* Vim never ceases to impress me
  * It has a built in session management system

* Doesn't make session plugins redundant
  * But rudimentary sessions are easy

== Sessions, ShaDa & Views ==
* Session
  * Basically the information required to rebuild your layout
  * Collection of Views
  * Not the same as a tmux session
    * Close vim without saving still loose changes
    * Closer to a workspace
* View
  * Properties of one window
  * Can be saved and loaded seperately

== Session What's Kept ==
* Controlled with sessionoptions
  * Default
    * empty windows blank
    * all buffers buffers
    * current directory curdir
    * folds folds
    * help window help
    * options options
    * window sizes winsize

* ShaDa
  * Shared data file
  * Written to when vim is quit
  * Useful to cover what sessions miss
  * Can use extras shada variable
    * Sticking with defaults today

== ShaDa What's Kept ==
* Basically pick the rest
  * Command-line and Search pattern history
  * Text in registers
  * Marks for various files
  * The buffer list
  * Global variables

== How ==
* mksession where to session to
* :source session file opens
* vim -S session file to open
* v:this_session stores session name

* mkview
* mkview with number
* mkview path
* loadview
* loadview with number
* source path

* Exchange between running instances
* wshada! location to save
* rshada! location to load from

* SessionLoadPost autocmd event
  * Automatically load shada

== Why Sessions ==
* Remember a project
* Remember a layout
* Restore known layout

== Issues ==
* Isn't a session like tmux
  * Not supposed to be
