* Most IOT devices are pretty dumb
	* Fridges, croc pots, locks
		* Especially locks go watch some lockpicking channels
* But I make one exception
	* Light globes

* Mirabella Genio
	* Every store that has light globes is selling it here
	* I bought B22 plug

* There is some convenience
	* Most australian houses don't have dimmers
	* Phone is a reasonable replacement
	* Scheduling the lights to dim at night
		* Unless you're reading you don't need much light
		* Brighten in the morning

* Reading
	* Usually just use my lamp
	* Still a bit too bright for my liking

* Streaming
	* Rainbow doesn't fit main content
	* Might make interesting mood for game streams
	* Podcast as well

* Scenes
	* Built in mode for rainbow switching
		* Defaults to flash instead of breathe
	* Can't make new scenes
		* Only have 8

* Shadow problem
	* Could use my lamp instead of overhead
	* Wall is the issue

* Synching
	* Absolute pain to sync
	* Show process
		* EZ Mode
		* AP Mode
	* Sometimes just times out for no reason
	* If wifi goes out have to resync

* Sadly have to do everything from phone
	* Being a general consumer electronic
	* No public api
	* Desktop app
