== What are they ==
* Vim originally authored by Bram Moolenaar
  * A clone of Bill Joy's vi editor
  * Specifically based the source code for Stevie editor
* Neovim began as a fork of Vim
  * Different from a lot of the other forks
    * Doesn't try to be fundamentally different editor
    * It's aim is to be the next step in this long editor history
  * To address what they saw as fundamental flaws in vim's development

== Community Development ==
* Vim takes on a benevolent dictator for life setup
  * https://github.com/vim/vim/commits
  * Everything committed is by Bram
    * Not to say other don't work on it
    * People do
      * He has final say on if it goes into the code base
  * Discussions primarily occur through the mailing list

* Neovim aims to make it easier to on board new contributors
  * https://github.com/neovim/neovim/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md
    * Documentation of how to commit
  * And give contributors more control
    * https://github.com/neovim/neovim/commits/master
* Neovim uses IRC, Gitter and it's github repo for discussions

== Project Speed ==
* Due to their different approaches
  * Neovim tends to move much faster
    * Experiment more
    * This isn't always a good thing
  * Being slower comes with a benefit though
    * Stability
  * Due to neovim being more willing to experiment
    * It's going to be a less stable
    * Not to say it's unstable but relative to vim

== Embedded Vim ==
* There are GUIs for vim
  * Vim is more tightly coupled
  * Development started as GUIs were gaining popularity

* NeoVims long term goal is to embeddable everywhere
  * Vscode neo vim runs full neovim in the background
  * Firenvim can embed neovim in your browser
  * The first release of neovim was just a refactor of vim
    * To make it more maintainable by their standards
    * Over time UI and backend have been decoupled

== Lua ==
* Lua is supported in both vim and neovim
  * But it's treated as just another plugin language in vim
* Neovim wants to take lua
  * Turn it into first class alternative to Vim Script

== Defaults ==
* neovim makes some changes to vim defaults
  * https://neovim.io/doc/user/vim_diff.html#nvim-defaults
* Obviously can be changed
  * These defaults exist because most vim users use them

== Similarities ==
* Story would be very different a few years ago
  * Now most differences aren't user facing
  * This is good
    * Vanilla vim and neovim feel identical
    * You wouldn't be able to tell the difference

* Prior to vim8 neovim had some major advantages
* Asynchronous api
  * Allowing for multi-threaded plugins
  * With modern CPUs offers a massive performance boost
* Embedded terminal
  * Neovim was first to add this feature
  * Let's you compile code or interact with git
    * Without closing editor
    * Massive improvement

== Competition ==
* Vim needed competition
  * It took 15 years for async i/o to be added
  * Hopefully neovim and vim continue to push each
