* Much simpler interface than cordless
	* Too it's advantage
	* Everything done through commands

* Only really a few bindings
	* Moving with arrow keys
	* / to enter command
	* ctrl-l to go to message
	* ctrl-h to go to list
	* Some tab completion

* First gripe is that it's slow to load
	* Not sure what the cause is
	* Otherwise my favorite terminal discord

* True color support
	* Can be disabled

* /goto
* /react
	* Really nice to see
* /editor
	* Use editor to write comment
* /mentions doesn't work
* /nick for nickname
* /status for status
* /presence playing or lisenting to
* /edit edit previous message
* /delete delete previous message
* /upload must be full file path
* /copy can't use mouse
* /dm
* /block
* /unblock

* Can't open links
	* Copy and paste into browser
	* Slight annoyance

* login
	* user name and password
		* Not recommended
	* token
		* Preferred method
		* Login to web client or desktop
		* Find auth token
	* Securely store token with something like gnome keyring
