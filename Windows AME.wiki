* A couple people asked me to talk about Windows AME
	* I had planned not to but here we are
	* It's not going to be positive though

* Missed the news
	* Windows 10 minus the "spyware" added "stabability and security"
	* It's not new by any means
	* A quick search shows videos from 2 years ago
		* Ltt discussed it

* Spyware systems abundant in windows 10 have not been disabled
	* Completely eliminated
		* Including windows update and related services
		* Core applications like Edge, Media Player, Cortana, any Appx Apps
		* Reducing ISO size 2GB and system footprint
		* All sounds good

* Breaks basic functionality
	* Tricks OS into thinking your offline
		* Breaks anything that queries OS for network status
			* Creative Cloud
	* Search reliant on Cortana
		* Should be configured in open shell
	* Some shortcuts like Windows + tab break
	* DirectX12 may work
		* Officially it doesn't
		* Depending on how new it is
		* Some game may be reliant on new patches
		* Gaming is a big reason to run a custom ISO

* Questionable legality
	* Legal notice explaining why it should be legal
	* I'm not a lawyer
		* Probably not an issue as an individual
		* Not the safest bet if you run a business
			* Not a can you want to open

* Made for a specific version of windows
	* If you want to use another version on your own

* Questionable ISO
	* Installing random ISOs is never a safe idea
		* I'm not saying this isn't I haven't tested it
	* No different from downloading an Ubuntu ISO from unofficial server
	* Or distro no one has ever used
		* Could be safe but no guarantee
	* Could very easily have some undesired code run
		* Keylogger, etc

* If worried about security you should
	* Takes 2 - 3 hours
		* Just reading and running what you're told
	* Probably longer if you're not comfortable on the command line
		* Or if no Linux
		* Customizing will be a serious problem

* A better method
	* NTLite
		* Graphical method
		* Works for most versions of Windows 10
		* Not just 1903
			* May not work straight after new version
		* Choose how much of Windows you want to break
		* I suggest watching https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZKq7kpCcuA&t=308s
