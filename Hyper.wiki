* This is a terminal written with web technologies
	* I know it's as weird as it sounds
	* But hear me out, it's surpringly usable

* Demonstration

* We have a context menu
* Built in multiplexer
	* Nothing out of the ordinary

* Plugins
	* Major point of value
	* Being basically a web frame
	* Basically limitless posibility for plugins
	* https://hyper.is/plugins
		* Can also pull in other javascript libraries

* Theme store
	* More than just terminal color pallets
	* https://hyper.is/themes
	* Couldn't get cyber punk to work
		* But as you saw before it should be doable

* I don't think I've ever seen a terminal with a package manager
	* Basically just a filtered npm
	* hyper i to install
	* hyper u to uninstall
	* hyper s search npm

* Looks a little different out of box
	* Hamburger menu
	* Window controls
	* Show config

* Weird blurred text
	* Never seen a terminal do this
	* Seems to only happen in tiling

* All keys can be rebound
	* At least in theory
	* Completely missing from the documentation

* Has a dependency on yarn

* Noticably slow load/quit being an electron app
	* Can open alacritty before hyper

* No I don't think you should use this
	* Giving random javascript this much system access
		* Not a good idea
	* I'm not the audience
		* What I want from a terminal is fairly limited
		* I don't care aboiut fancy effects
* Pretty interesting experiment though
