* Luke did a video talking
  * About he's a boomer that doesn't follow Linux
  * Snaps and Flatpaks terrible
  * Briefly talked about flatkill
    * So let's go over all the arguments
    * Because he didn't

* Go over 2020 version afterwards

== Sandbox ==
https://docs.flatpak.org/en/latest/sandbox-permissions.html
* home - access the userâ€™s home directory
* host - access normal files on the host, not including host os
  * These directories are blacklisted: /lib, /lib32, /lib64, /bin, /sbin, /usr, /boot, /root, /tmp, /etc, /app, /run, /proc, /sys, /dev, /var
  * Exceptions from the blacklist: /run/media
    * Removable media
  * /etc, /usr
* Device Access
  * --device=all can be used to access devices like controllers or webcams.
    * Can be limited to specific device
    * Odd inclusion

* Include apps
  * Take at face value

* Sandbox icon is misleading

== Security Updates ==
* Slightly disingenuous
  * Not completely wrong

* Presumably fixed 2 years on
  * CVE-2018-11235
    * Arbitrary code execution vulnerability exploitable via specially crafted submodule names in a .gitmodules file
  * CVE-2018-17456
    * Arbitrary code execution vulnerability via a specially crafted .gitmodules file in a project cloned with --recurse-submodules

* Very much depends on the developer
  * Some apps will have parallel updates
  * They are very popular though
* Distros have same
  * Segmentation issue not flatpak issue
  * Ubuntu apps also don't get security patches until months later
    * Usually old version in repos

== Local Root Exploit ==
* Read paragraph
  * Seem to have some priority adjustments to do
  * Completely fair criticism

== Future of application Distribution ==
* Read Paragraph
* In 2018 besides mistakes, fair complaints

* Now over to the 2020 version

== Sandbox ==
* Seems to have fixed the device=all mistake
  * Exact same problem still
  * In same applications
    * Continue on

== Security Vulnerabilities ==
* In 2020 developers are still lazy

* First exploit doesn't seem to exist
  * In CVE database
  * Buffer overflow leading to out of bounds read

* Official run times
  * Much more serious
  * Can't be chalked up to segmentation
  * CVE doesn't exist
    * Don't know if this is intentionally misleading
    * Or just incorrect url

* Bundled library updates

== Local Exploits ==
* Seem to have fixed their attitude about root exploits

== Desktop Integration ==
* Basic font rendering settings now function
* Theming issues

* IME has a really annoying requirement
* Multiple daemons and switch between

* Most arguments are valid
  * And it's good to call out the developers to fix issues
