* Installing Picom is kind of a mess
  * There's so many disparate forks all with awesome features
  * But the standard repos always behind

* I like having my window blur
  * Think it looks nicer than transparency
  * Especially on videos

* I had to use the picom-tryone-git fork for ages
  * That fork was a bit behind
  * Missing other picom performance improvements
  * New settings and so forth
  * But no more

== Enable Window Blur ==
* Ensure you have window transparency enabled
  * I typically use class_g
  * Uses the window class name
    * Easy to get with xprop
* Other options are
  * client
  * window type
  * leader
  * class_i
  * role
  * Names won't be the same in xprop
    * Sometimes not all are present
      * class seems to be the most consistent

backend=glx;
* Defaults to xrender
  * Generally a safe fall back if picom is really unstable
  * I've never seen any major issues with nvdia, or amd gpus
    * glx needs to work for this to work
* Glx switches to opengl rendering
  * Higher performance allowing for fun new rendering
  * All the branched features use this
blur-method="dual_kawase";
* Picom already supported kernel blur
  * I've never been able to get it to work
  * People who have say it's quite slow
  * Dual_kawase run in parellel making advantage of your cpus power
blur-strengh=7;
* Level of blur to use for dual_kawase
  * Number from 0 to 20

* Once you set a method
  * Blur enabled by default for everything

* Disable it for window types
  * Most windows fall under the normal category
  * Check with xprop

* If you using fading
  * It does seg fault under certain conditions with Alacritty
  * I'm trying pin down the exact cause

== Closing ==
* I will be doing a follow up
  * Showing you how insane the picom situation is

* Only thing missing is rounded windows
  * Which may have already bee merged and I missed it
  * If I did let me know
