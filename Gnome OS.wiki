Title: Gnome OS Isn't Real, It Can't Hurt You

* I keep hearing all this talk about a Gnome OS
	* And it seems like a lot of people aren't reading past the title
		* It's a terrible idea, people will abandon other distro

* The Gnome foundation has been sending ISOs out to journalists and devs
	* This ISO is custom Linux distro based entirely around Gnome
	* Not based on any distro
	* No package manager

* This isn't new
	* Infact it's been around for about 8 years in another form

https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/GnomeContinuous
* Gnome Continuous
	* The project was born to solve a seemingly simple problem:
		* The GNOME designers need to be able to try what they're designing,
		* As it's being implemented.
			* It's useless to try and design code without a testing framework

	* Who should use this
	* Machines
		* Automated testing
	* Human GNOME developers and testers who want to see GNOME as it is few minutes ago from git master
		* Intentionally not stable
	* Makes use of OSTree for continous update integration

	* Non goals
		* Gnome-continuous system does not replace general-purpose GNU/Linux distributions

	* 8 Years ago this was a testing distro
		* Don't worry about changing dependencies build system specifically for Gnome
		* Articles about it at the time

* What about in 2020
	* About 5 months ago

* How about now
	* Previously the testing ISO was really only working in a VM
		* And really unstable
	* With release of Gnome 3.38 Orbis
	* Due to efforts from Gnome and Codethink
		* It's possible to run on hardware

* This isn't really a GNOME OS
	* Not in the normal sense
	* It's basically a testing platform
	* Used to explore new Gnome features
		* Journalists can write articles
		* Youtubers can make videos
			* Without waiting for it to be available on there distro
	* Implement new features
		* Without worrying about distro inconsistencies
	* Integration issues between Gnome tools
		* Most system won't use all
	* Try out the newest version of Gnome before it hits your distro

	* Unless you're a developer
		* This is basically a marketing tool

	* It's not a desktop OS
		* That's not an insult
		* It's simpl not the point of it

* This isn't the KDE Neon of Gnome
	* Maybe one day it will be not right now
