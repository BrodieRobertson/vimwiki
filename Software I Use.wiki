* Window Manager
	* Bspwm
	* Still really happy with it
		* Want to experiment with others
		* DWM, Qtile, Xmonad

* Status Bar
	* Polybar
		* It's just the easiest bar to configure
		* Mine needs some optimization

* Terminal
	* Alacritty
		* Main terminal
	* St
		* Off chance something breaks

* Shell
	* ZSH
	* Nice Vim mode
	* Tab completion
	* Syntax highlighting
	* Command not found
		* Also in bash
	* Set and forget

* Prompt
	* Starship
	* Very stripped down
		* Should try out Pure

* Hotkey daemon
	* Sxhkd
	* Bspwm requires a standalone hotkey daemon
		* Most are just Sxhkd clones that don't offer much


* Launcher
	* Patched dmenu
	* Standard choice in i3
		* No reason to stop using it
		* Rofi looks cool though

* Browser
	* Brave
	* Firefox installed as well
		* Just for testing

* Emails
	* Thunderbird
	* Also calender/schedule
		* Convenient to be able to load graphics
		* Same reason I don't run terminal browser

* File Manager
	* GUI - PCManFM
	* Terminal - Lf
	* Generally use LF
		* When working with GUI apps I use PCManfm

* PDF Reader
	* Zathura

* Image viewer
	* Sxiv
	* Besides dmenu
		* Only suckless utility I actively use

* Media Player
	* Mpv
	* Don't listen to music on my computer usually
	* If I do it's spotify-tui

* Editor
	* Neovim

* Torrents
	* Transmission
	* Tremc for interface

* Distro
	* Just Arch
	* Nothing special
	* Might switch to Artix when I have time
