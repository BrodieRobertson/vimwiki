= DSLR Shooting =

Usually 24 fps

== What should I buy ==

* Indoor Vlogging
* 18mm focal length
* F/2.8

* 16-35mm
* F2.8

* B-roll
* F/1.4 - F/1.8
* 30 - 35 mm


== What is a crop frame camera ==

* Multiply focal length by 1.5 to get true focal length

== What is a full frame camera ==

# Crop Factor

# Camera Settings

=== Focus ===

* Always use manual focus
* So you have control over what's in focus

=== Aperture ===

* Controls the amount of let that can enter
* Controls background blur
* F/1.4 Shallow Depth of Field
* F/8 Deep Depth of field
* For a nice depth of field between F/1.2 - F/4

=== ISO ===

* Sensitvity to light
* 100 - 6400

=== Shutter Speed ===

* Shutter speed should be double frame rate

# Colour Profile

=== Sharpness ===

* Disable to avoid lines in distant objects
* Reduces fine details
* Just do in post

=== Contrast ===

* Disable to retain details in shadows

=== Saturation ===

* Slightly desaturate

== Audio ==

* Audio and video recorded separetly and then synced in post

== Colour Temperature ==

* Daylight - 5500 - 5600 Kelvin
* Artificial 3100 - 3400 Kelvin

== Night Shooting ==

* More noise at high ISO - Max 1600 at night
* Don't go higher then 1/50s shutter speed - some lights flicker
* Shot brighter with aperature F/1.2 - F/4 or F/5.6

== Daylight Shooting ==

* Typically better to shoot underexposed to retain detail
* Fix in post

== Neutral Density Filter ==

=== Example ===

Aperture F/2.8
Shutter Speed 1/50s
ISO 100
Daylight conditions

Leads to heavily over exposed shot
In photography you could increase shutter speed to 1000 to fix this
In Filmography can use a neutral density filter to address this

== Lens ==

* More focal length leads to more compression
* Makes subject pop

=== What is a fast lens ===

* Let's a lot of light in - open aperature

=== Kit Lens ===

* Basic lens that comes with camera
* 16 - 50mm
* F/3.5-5.6
* Zoom is fairly flexible
* Can go in reasonably far and reasonably wide
* Typically image stabalized
* Not great at low light

=== Ultra Wide Angle ===

* 10 - 18mm
* F/4
* Can see a lot of the scene
* The wider the lens the more stable
* Typically very expensive
* Not very blurry background
* Not very fast, low aperature will probably have to crank iso
* Might be good for going out

=== 24 - 70mm ===

* F/2.8
* Good middle ground

=== 50mm Prime (Nifty Fifty) ===

* Not for vlogging
* Unless on full frame RIP wallet
* Might be good for closeup b-roll

=== Wide Angle Prime ===

* 16mm
* F/1.4
* Douchy Vlogging lens
* Very blurry background
* Typically heavily
* Expensive
* Not image stabalized
* Hard to keep focused

=== Macro Lens ===

* Good for closeup photography
* Or use extension tube
