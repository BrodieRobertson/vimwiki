* YouTube's spam comes and goes
	* But it's been relentless for the past year

* First was the tim/tem/tom bots
	* Saying great video
	* Eventually changed their names

* Recently it spiked up again
	* Community post from DT https://www.youtube.com/post/Ugz-etjFOECv1HuZ0lp4AaABCQ

== Identifying the Problem ==
* Generally some inane message
	* Nice, great, do you love me, I love you
	* A ton of emoji
	* A time stamp
		* More on that in a bit
	* A assume girl with big boing boing

== Time Stamp ==
* I'm not sure what the criteria for this is
	* Clearly it's not video length
	* I've had +20 on a 10 min video
		* I don't think it matters
		* Blue text makes the comment stand out more
			* Same as for the emoji

* Some thought timestamps were embedded links
	* Not possible on youtube

== Don't Seem To Be Fake Accounts ==
* Some have sub counts and existing videos
	* It's not just bitcoin, cash app or other scams

* It's likely that these were compromised accounts
	* Go to about

== Why Though ==
* I've seen links in comments or in about previously
	* That's an obvious phishing attempt
	* YouTube pretty good at stopping that
		* But that's not here this time
			* Accounts give no indication of purpose

* It may simply be to ruin the comment section
	* Unless it's a competing platform
	* No financial incentive
* A different approach to growing and selling
	* Account blackmarkets exists
	* Maybe boing boing profile pics is a new approach

== Solution ==
* Sadly don't think there's anyway to get these channels back to owner
	* Most are tiny channels
		* From owners in 3rd world countries
	* Biggest I've seen is 1.5k
	* Probably why no one is doing anything
* Because they're not saying anything bad
	* Positive effect on the algorithm
* Can't convince me that YouTube
* Company that auto claims 1 sec of audio in 30 min of video
	* Doesn't have tech to solve this
* Even ignoring content
	* YouTube already uses image recognition for auto claiming
	* These profile pic shouldn't slip through

* YouTube doesn't have a financial incentive to do anything
	* What are you gonna do
	* Go to a different video platform
		* Know you won't so instead focus resources elsewhere
