* Stable means multiple things
	* Stable release
	* System stability
		* Does the kernel crash
		* Do programs die out nowhere

* Multiple Questions
	* Is Kernal Stable
	* Are packages stable
		*	Official Packages
		* AUR
		* Compile yourself
	* Configurations

* Kernal
* I've had 1 kernel panic
* May be related to the broken hardware in laptop
* No less stable than other kernals

* Official packages
* Tend to be better tested
* Only problem for me was manual intervention

* AUR
* Still manual intervention
* Some die more visually than others
* Undocumented conflicts

* Not marked as out of date
* Tremc and transmission-remote-cli

* Compile stuff yourself
* You're pretty much on your own
* Be careful what you compile

* Configurations
* Xorg configured wrong will not start
* Xinitrc don't fork programs
* Replacing nvidia with nouveau

* Stable as you want it to be
