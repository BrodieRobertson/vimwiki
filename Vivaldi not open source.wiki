* Might have seen DTs video on why Vivaldi is not open source
	* Released article explaining why they've done
	* I've used Vivaldi, I like Vivaldi
		* If you do that's cool, that's no skin off my back
		* Wanted to explain why they do this
	* You can get the source
		* But it's not open source
			* Can't fork

* To many people, the question of releasing Vivaldi browserâ€™s source code under a unified open-source license seems to be clear-cut.
	* Same thought before reading
* Business model
	* Partnerships with search engines
		* Not google
	* Partnerships with websites
		* Amazon, ebay, tripadvisor, etc
			* Make a purchase from this link, Vivaldi makes income

* Vivaldi browser is part open-source, part closed-source
	* 3 Layers
	* Backend released under a BSD license
		* 3 clause BSD license
		* Accepted as open source by OSI
		* Anyone saying it's not hasn't seen the license
	* 3rd party software
		* Depends on vendors
	* UI Layer closed

* Vivaldi Brand
	* The obfuscation is partly there to improve performance
		* Don't know how true this is
		* Minified would improve
	* But should we be afraid of forks in the first place?
		* I was under tha assumption backend was also closed source
		* Would have said
	* Vivaldi is a brand
		* Isn't just some random project on GitHub
		* Company backing it
		* Stopping competition
			* If you want to compete do the work
		* Not a problem for big projects
			* GIMP fork that I won't name
			* But Vivaldi is small
				* Overshadowed by fork
		* Associated with projects
			* Negative affect brand
	* I can respect that argument
		* I'm not do or die open source

* Open-source processes are costly too
	* Never considered this
		* Looked at it from the code side
		* Didn't think of the submission side
	* Code from brilliant developers
	* Can't bring on team
		* Too young
		* 2nd job
	* Open sourcing project could massively improve

* What of the security benefits?
	* Will consider open sourcing more for security

* What happens if Vivaldi dies?
	* Build Chromium based browser after annoyed with Opera
	* I read as
	* Consider open sourcing if they collapse

* No going back
	* Would have to completely rewrite from scratch
	* Massive time an cost & time commitment
		* For no benefit

* Mod Vivaldi to customize it even more
	* Most browsers build UI in same language as backend
		* Typically have CSS in other browsers

* Should Vivaldi browser be open-source?
	* Users perspective absolutely
		* Choice, vivaldi fork
		* Free to modify
	* Stay like this for as long as they protect brand
