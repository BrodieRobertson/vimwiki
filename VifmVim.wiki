* Plugin brings vifm file manager into vim
  * Heard good things
* Not going to bother going over keys
  * See my last vifm video for that

* Focus on specifically what this plugin can do

* Yes I know you can use float term
  * I did a video on it

== Open Commands ==
* EditVifm open a file or multiple files in current tab
  * Aliased to Vifm
  * All commands accept up to 2 arguments
    * First is left pane directory
    * Second is right
      * I never use right
      * Always have preview
  * Buffers are different from tabs
    * Plan to do a video on them
* Can do tabs as well
  * TabVifm

* Likewise horizontal SplitVifm
  * And vertical VSplitVifm

== Diffs ==
* Diffing files in vim is a bit annoying
* :diffthis, :diffthis
* Instead
  * DiffVifm and done

* Commands actually don't matter
  * Adds commands into vifm when run in vim

== Color Scheme Conversion ==
* Attempts to convert vim colour scheme into vifm colour scheme
* Doesn't work with termguicolors true color
* Isn't perfect but surprisingly good
  * Suggest using as baseline

== Configuration ==
* Not a ton of configuration
  * Most configuration done on vifm side
* Replace folder view with vifm
  * vifm_replace_netrw
  * vifm_replace_netrw_cmd
    * Editor command not vifm commands sadly
  * Also disable netrw
    * netrw-noload
    * No point wasting resources

vifm_exec_arg
  * Specify options for vifm
    * Might use custom config in vim
      * Can't guarentee image previews work
      * Especially in gui vims

* vifm_embed_term
  * Open vifm in terminal buffer
  * Effectively always true in nvim

* vifm_embed_split
  * Open vifm in a split

* Plugin comes with vifm documentation
  * I'm not too sure why
  * I would direct people to that instead

== Outro ==
* Does file manager integration as well you'd expect
  * Could absolutely extend
    * Everything need is here
  * I really like the idea of adding new commands into vifm
    * Made by same developer as vifm
