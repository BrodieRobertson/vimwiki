* Another one of the rare productive rust rewrites
	* Rust rewrite of ps
		* That command you only remember how it works when needed

* procs tries to simplify the config process
	* And add some extra functionality

* First run look like this
	* PID
	* User
	* TTY seems to show nothing if same as current
	* CPU %
	* MEM %
	* total CPU time
	* command launched with

* Pager is just less -SR

== Adding Columns ==
* Can be massively expanded
	* Enable config

	* Let's add something not in ps
		* Add new columns section
			* make sure the s is there
			* On Github we have full list
			* Style can be color name
				* { Color256 = 223 }
				* ByPercentage, ByStatem By Unit
			* numeric_search enable numeric search
			* nonnumeric_search enable non numeric search

== Clean Output ==
* Nice thing about no colouring is clean output
	* Makes it easy to using with sed, awk, grep, etc
* Piping this cleans output
* Same as redirecting to file

== Searching ==
* numeric matches on PID by default
	* exact match
	* anything with numeric_search enabled is included
* alpha requires partial match

* --and, --or --nand, --nor
	* --and l y
	* --or doesn't mean english or

== Tree ==
* Switches to sorting in dependency order
	* Draws dependencies

== Column Sorting ==
* --sorta kind
* --sortd kind

== Insert Column ==
* Relies on adding special kind of column called Slot
	* Won't be shown unless being used
	* Specify where column should be placed

== Watch Mode ==
* --watch --watch-interval
* Like top
	* n sort by next
	* p sort by prev
	* a ascend
	* d descend
	* q quit

== Can all be combined ==
procs --tree --watch --and l y

== Configuration ==
* Most values can be changed from config
	* Well documented on github

== Issues ==
* Most configuration done from config great
	* Should provide overrides in many cases missing
	* Insert arbitrary columns
