* Typically people think about XDG
	* User directories
		* documents, music, desktop, etc
	* Base Directories
		* Data dir, cache dir, config dir, etc
	* Maybe you think about Xdg mime, or xdg open
		* Consistently launching applications

* But where does it all come from
	* In 2000 a new group called X Desktop Group (XDG)
		* Havoc Pennington of Red Hat
		* The X is supposed to be Cross, but no one says that
	* Later changing their name to Free desktop.org
		* But the XDG moniker stuck for many projects
			* Some projects would be confusingly

* Formed to work on interoperability and shared base technology
	* For desktop environments under X11 and Wayland
	* But it didn't exist at the time
			* Didn't come till 2008

* Unlike POSIX
	* Created by the IEEE as design for what Unix should be to be

* Free Desktop isn't a strict standard
	* Some projects replace each other
	* It's a group for discussing ideas
	* Aimed towards interoperability
		* Much more room to change than stricter standards like POSIX
	* Isn't always a good thing
		* But allows it to adapt more quickly to newer tech

* So no certification
	* No requirement to implement all specifications
	* As with POSIX though
		* Stop implementing at spec borders
			* Don't half implement spec
			* Otherwise defeats the point

* Even so their tools and specifications are in wide use
	* As Gnome, KDE, XFCE, 3 notable DEs that collaborate with free desktop
	* Some of their apps hosted on Freedesktop servers

* In 2006 with help of KDE and Gnome, begun Portland Project
	* Better known as xdg-utils
	* Implements some of the specs discussed in a bit
		* To commit to interoperability, show that they work
		* How we got
			* xdg-mime, xdg-open, xdg-desktop-icon, xdg-desktop-menu

* Specifications in wide use
	* Autostart
		* How apps started on login
		* How removable media can request specific app to be excuted
	* Desktop entries/Desktop menus
		* Your .desktop files
			* App icon, name, description
		* And menus built from them
	* File Uris
		* Used for handling drag and dropping of files
	* Media Player Remote Interfacing Specification MPRIS
		* Dbus interface for media players
	* XML Bookmark Exchange Language
		* Standard for browser bookmarks
	* Trash can
* Full list down below

* Plenty of ideas bouncing around
	* May end up being important one day
	* But since no certification can't force the change

* Just specs
	* They do have real projects, developed or hosted

* Also things like
	* D-bus
		* inter process communication
	* NetworkManager
		* Network discovery and configuration, for wired and wireless
	* PulseAudio
		* Sound system
	* Fontconfig
		* Library for font access
	* Nouveau
		* Reverse engineered nvidia drivers
	* libinput
		* Interface for input devices like keyboards, mice, touchpads

	* X.Org and Wayland
		* X.Org Foundation joined Freedesktop in 2018
		* All relavent graphics servers under Freedesktop

* Very important group shaping the way the Linux desktop functions
	* No one really knows they exist
	* You can always try to avoid it
	* But a lot of apps only acknowledge the free desktop tools
		* Mime being a good example

* No one bats an eye about Freedesktop.org
	* Being a red hat project
