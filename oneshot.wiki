* I'm going to say this now
	* Don't use this on public wifi
	* Or really any network you don't trust

* One shot http server
	* Obviously you could use FTP
	* Or any number of other methods
	* But this is dead simple

* Basic usage
oneshot ~/pictures/stallman.jpg
	* Can send multiple files as archive
	* Just an http server
		* Works on phone

* Change port
	* -p 8080

* Password protection
oneshot -U username -W ~/pictures/torvalds.png
	* Just basic http auth
	* Probably shouldn't show password
	* Also supports https
	* With --tls-key and --tls-cert
		* Outside of this videos scope
	* -P to give password file

* Recieve
oneshot -u .
* No version for android but you can still send file
	* Or from seperate computer
	* Or even from yourself
	* Send file to VM
		* No thumbdrives
		* No shared folders

* Recieve to standard out
oneshot -u | less
* Maybe sending some sort of document
	* Or need to process it

* Recieve in browser
oneshot -D ~/pictures/77012728_p0.jpg
oneshot -D ~/oneshot.html

* Send results of a lengthy command
fc-list | oneshot -n fonts.txt
