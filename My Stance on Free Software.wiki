* Free Software advocate
	* Short answer generally yes
	* Proper answer takes a bit longer
		* Releasing software, how other software should be released, software I use
		* Eliminating closed source software

* Releasing software
	* Scripts, configs, occasional software
	* Anything intended for public use, generally GPL
	* Or just for the memes WTPFL
	* No reason to not open source
		* Suggestions from others
		* Channel about helping people
		* Some people like to use their favourite creators configs

* How software should be released
	* Do whatever you want
		* Do whatever you think suits your company
		* Not a do or die free and open source advocate
	* Free as in monetary
		* No ads, no in app purchases
		* No justifiable reason to be closed source
		* Securuity by obscurity
	* Not against ads or in app purchses for mobile apps
		* Prefer absolutely free with a donation system
		* For garbage I'll accept ads
			* Buzzer for trivia
		* Simple mobile tools
		* Donations great for a lot of traction
	* Keep ads out of desktop apps
		* Completely free with donations
	* Paid software
		* Some software too much work to leave up to donations
		* Can argue software shouldn't be this big
			* Hard to avoid
				* Game Engines, Video Editor, 3D Modelling
		* Large team, long dev time, etc

* Software I use
	* 2 equivalent tools
		* 1 Open source, 1 closed
		* Will pick open source 100% of time
	* Generally not realistic
		* Usually 1 is the better software
		* More features I need/less I don't, quicker, smaller, customizable
	* Open source is a selling point
		* Richer plugin environment
		* Application forks
		* More helpful community
		* Community involvement in project
	* Some closed source tool is better
		* IDE suite of choice is JetBrains
		* I've used open source solutions like Eclipse
			* Pales in comparison
		* In this case no worries about using closed source

* Software pragmatism
	* Pick the best tool for the job
	* Regardles of closed or open source
	* Rather than picking open source for the sake of open source
	* The fact I use open source a lot says a lot about the software
	* Adobe suite on Linux, would instantly drop Kdenlive
		* Not saying much because it's awful
		* When Olive is stable i'm dropping it

* Eliminating closed source software
	* Not effecting me I don't care
	* Don't see any reason to use Parabola
	* If I had an Nvidia care I'd use the drivers that work

* Completely open to changing my mind
	* Initially I did everything with FOSS
	* Even if it handy capped me
	* But shifted over the past year
	* Will be completely different next year
