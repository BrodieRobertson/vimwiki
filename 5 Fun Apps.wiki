    * No level of YouTuber energy could make a long video

== Genact ==

* Pretend like you're when your boss comes around
    * Cycles through random modules
    * List modules -l
    * Specify -m
    * Speed -s

== Term-Fireworks ==
* Generate random terminal fireworks
* Specify seed
    * fireworks --seed 1234567

    * Chose to use the blockish version
    * Generates everything with unicode blocks

    * Don't get me wrong it's cool
    * What's wrong with simple numbers

== CMatrix ==

    * Incredibly CPU intensive
        * My CPU doesn't care

    * Has keybindings for some reason
        * Shift num keys for colour
        * a async scroll
            * More CPU intensive
        * b random bold
        * B all bold
        * n no bold
            * May do nothing if terminal doesn't support bold chars properly
        * 0-9 adjust speed
            * Faster more cpu intensive
    * Done from options as well
        * Only one you probably care about is
        * -s screen saver
