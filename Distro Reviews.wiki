== First Looks Are Not Reviews ==
* First Looks/showcases are not reviews
  * May look similiar, terms may be used interchangeably
  * Fundamentally different

* To review must sit with for a few days, maybe weeks
  * General understanding system
    * Understand apps installed
    * Understand how apps configured
    * Maybe even developer methodology

* Take DTs rare distro videos
  * Structured similiarly to how I do software showcases
  * Enough prep to know what you're talking about
    * Much more time for distro
  * Haven't dug through every config
    * Or even most
  * Know general apps installed
    * DE/WM Terminal, editor, browser, email client, launcher

* First looks have value
  * Give an idea of your starting point
  * Only thing that matters in distro choice
    * Everything else can change

== Review ==
* But there's no point
* No one except
  * Grandma who you installed Mint for using stock
  * On 10 year laptop
* Everyone modifies configs
  * Even just installing different theme
* Installs new apps
* Maybe even replaces window manager/DE
  * If included in review are you reviewing the same thing

* Knowing extra review things doesn't add much

== Distro Showdowns Make Less Sense ==
* Let's take Kubuntu vs Xubuntu
  * Both just ubuntu with a different skin
  * Could install Kubuntu get rid of KDE, install XFCE
    * Are these now the same thing

  * Most distros are just skins
  * Differences between bases
    * Not as much as you think

== What Seperates A Distro ==
* Take Arch and Manjaro
  * Nothing stopping you installing Arch
  * Pointing package manager to manjaro repos
  * Installing all Manjaro defaults
    * Software, Kernal, Configs
  * Long detour but now you have Manjaro

* True for anything based on Arch or any other base

* What seperates a distro is package management
  * Arch is Arch because of Pacman
  * Ubuntu is Ubuntu because of Apt

* Even that's not a hard rule
  * I've talked to people who've turned Debian into Arch

* Borders so thin on Linux
  * Know what you're doing nothing stops you

== Exceptions ==
* Bedrock Linux
  * Meta distro intended to bring in packaging from other distros

* Distri
  * Research distro
  * Implements Daniel Bernstein's alternative to package handling

* GnomeOS
  * A testing environment for journalists and developers
  * Try out cutting edge features before other systems

* I'm not saying you can't like them
  * Do what you want with your time
  * I personally won't make them
