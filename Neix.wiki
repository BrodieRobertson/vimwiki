* My main RSS feed reader is Newsboat
	* Thought it'd be fun to explore
	* So here we are with Neix
	* Much simpler app but gets the job done

== Usage ==
* j/k - up/down articles
* Shift+j/k up down feeds
	* Shift+up/down doesn't work in this case
* Enter to open
* o to open in browser
* q to close article

== Import Feeds ==
* Accepts OPMLv2 file, seems to be the standard for this
* That's what newsboat exports
newsboat -e

neix -i
neix -e

== Get Some Feeds ==
.config/neix/feeds.conf
Sadly no way to add in app

* Current version seems to have debug statements in it

* No way to refresh in app
	* Refreshes on launch

== Configuration ==
* dateFormat
* locale
	* Want it to differ from system locale
* openCommand
	* Program to open article
	* defaults to xdg-open
* renderText
	* w3m -dump -T tex/html

== Issues ==
* Most people probably won't have this problem
	* I don't like losing old articles
	* This is how I get my video ideas, sometimes lazy
		* Month articles
		* Could change feed max but it was removed
* Due to relying on WM hides some article info
	* Missing links may contain useful info
		* But you could write your own parser
		* Format exactly as you want
* No way to do grouping into folders or tagging like newboat
	* Too many feeds may be hard to handle
* Alternate colour schemes shown off on github
	* Seems to have been removed from my version

== Conclusion ==
* Newsboat is the best and most configurable terminal RSS client
	* But if just to read articles
	* Don't care about fancy filtering or other cool stuff
	* Neix is a perfectly good option
