* 3 Methods to do image previews

* First 1 relies on W3M
	* https://github.com/gokcehan/lf/wiki/Previews#image-preview
	* So no Alacritty or St
	* And I guess is technically not a preview
	* Works better than solution 2

* Setup process

* Second 1 relies on Ueberzug
	* Proper image preview
	* Very hacky
	* Lf Doesn't Provide a better way to handle this
	* Reload with ctrl-r
	* Modified version with lf -remote "send reload"

* Setup process

* Third way
	* I've gotten used to no previews
	* Just use an image viewer
	* Use some sort of window swallow script
		* Devour
		* Call only when needed

* True image previews aren't coming any time soon
	* https://github.com/gokcehan/lf/issues/134
	* Vifm, ranger are the place to go
	* I'm used to not having them at this point
	* Use an image viewer if I need them
