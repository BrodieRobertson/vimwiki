* to lazy to build vimrc yourself
	* just generate something that works fairly well

* Selection of fairly popular languages
	* Can't be everything but it'll cover many use cases

* Oddly only Vue js for web frameworks
	* Supporting react and Angular is pretty straight forward

* Color schemes are fairly limited
	* But codedark is here, only one that matters
	* Would be cool to see these images be the theme pallete

* Supports vim and neovim

* Checks if you've installed plugins
	* Checks which os you're using
	* Tries to install vim-plug
	* Sort of sets the tend for the rest of the config

* File tree
	* Nerdtree
		* Nerd tree tabs
		* F3 to open
		* No binding for tabs
	* Also fzf if you'd prefer a fuzzy finder
		* Leader e

* Vim commentary for commenting
	* But no binding for it

* Nice to see vim fugitive
	* Git integration

* Git gutter seems to be misconfigured

* With exuberant ctags can view code tags with
	* Tagbar

* Indent line
	* Demo in code

* Polyglot to handle most syntax highlighting

* Code snippets with ultisnips
	* Bizarrely doesn't include code completion
	* No Coc or even Deoplete, YCM
		* Ale for syntax checking

* Vim session management
	* Never used myself but it seems fairly useful

* Language packs basically just add extra syntax
	* HTML does give you emment which is cool

* Visual settings all sensible defaults
	* 256 color mode for max compatibility
	* Gvim settings as well

* Abbreviations so you never accidently type wrong command

* Interesting mappings
	* Fugitive commands
	* Session management
	* Making tabs actually usable

* Fixes copying to clipboard

* Fixing split movement

* Fixing visual mode shifting

* Minor changes depending on language extensions

* Powerline symbols odd inclusion
	* Known to not render properly in nvim

* Documentation seems a bit lacking
	* Plugin grouping seems a bit random

* Very uncontroverisal vim config
	* But in doing so lacks a lot of basic tools

* I wouldn't use this myself but
	* If nothing else this is a great way to discover new plugins and config
