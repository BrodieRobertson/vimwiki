* Previously I looked z.lua
  * Learns frequently visited folders
  * Provides a shorthand way to cd between folders

== Basic Demo ==
* Mention autojump and j
* If you didn't see that
* Show off single depth
* Show off mpvscreenshots regular screenshots

== Weight Training ==
* Initially program useless
* Train by moving between folders with cd

* Show DB -s
  * Left hand side weights and associated path
    * When you make a query, path with highest weight is used
      * Not 100% on equal weights
        * Seems to be shortest path
    * Total weight of db, db size, weight of current directory
      * Also data path, not in home by default
        * big plus for me
* Show example not in db
* Show db again

* Unlike z.lua
  * Manually adjust
  * -i to increase weight
  * -d to decrease weight
    * Doesn't directly increase or decrease
  * Add directory without cding -a
    * Defaults weight to 10
  * Purging no existent folders
    * j --purge

== Open Folder In File Manager ==
* jo
  * Demonstration
* My xdg-open different from terminal file manager
* .autojump/share/autojump/autojump.zsh
  * No idea why the install script puts it here
  * modify lf line
  * If you want gui file manager no issue

== Open Child Folder ==
* jc
* Seems to prioritize child folder
  * screenshots instead of scripts
  * no match will fall back on default functionality

== Open Child in File Manager ==
* Combine functionality of jc and jo
  * As you would expect it to work

== Odd Tab Completion ==
* j --complete
* Odd underscore method
* Never seen this before

== Clearing DB ==
* No command to clear history
  * Just a plain text file however
  * We could manually adjust weights here as well
  * Be careful not to ruin formatting

== Installation Note ==
* Can be installed from AUR
  * Recommend using manual install to see post install note
  * Need to make changes to rc file
  * Show rc

== Issues ==
* As with z.lua
  * Random lag spikes

== Thoughts ==
* Auto jump seems like a perfectly fine tool
  * z.lua learnt from some of it's mistakes
  * Handling collisions better
  * Passing through cd
