* My default requirement for a terminal is true color
* But what does that even mean

* Important to know what a terminal is
	* What we call a terminal is actually a terminal emulator
	* Designed to emulate physical terminals
	* Including limitations
	* For many years did this
	* However, this doesn't have to be the case
	* Kitty with it's image module, W3M image rendering, anti-aliased fonts
	* And of course true color

* 4 Categories of Terminal Colors
* Plain ASCII
	* Monochrome terminal
	* Completely unheard of now
	* Basically just a relic of the past

* 16 Color Palette
	* ANSI Escape Codes
	* Set by the users terminal theme
	* TTY is an example of this
	* Show [[Image]]


* 256 Color Palette
	* Most modern terminals in this category
	* 16 ANSI colors
	* 24 grays
	* 216 colors
	* URXVT
	* Generally colors derived from ANSI colors
	* Can be modified in some terminals
	* Alacritty being one
	* Color test


* 24 Bit True Color
	* 16 million colors aka Full RGB
	* Independent from terminal theme
	* Show theme
	* Modify theme


* Why use true color
	* Aesthetic
	* I'd argue that aesthetics are actually useful
	* Rather than rely on a pallete meaning of which changes
	* Allows for specific colours to be used and appear consistent
	* Editor theme for example
	* I love syntax highlighting
	* Visual Studio theme in everything
	* Could get used to something else
	* Can easily identify constucts based on color
	* Switching would make me work slower

* True color terminals
	* st
	* konsole
	* iTerm2
	* Alacritty
	* Kitty
	* Windows Powershell
	* cmd.exe

* Do you need true color
	* Absolutely not
	* You'll be fine with a 256 terminal
	* If you really care about your colors
	* Maybe give one a shot
