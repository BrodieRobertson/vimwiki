* Recently covered GitUI
	* Thought I should cover another popular git interface

* Way more coverage of git
	* Much less information

* Status s
	* u stage/unstage
	* M to merge
	* ! revert
	* C commit
* Diff f
	* @ cycle hunks
	* [ ] cycle amount of context
* Main m
	* H goto head
	* Change view
		* F refs
		* G graph
		* A author
		* D Dates
* Log l
* Refs r
	* C checkout
	* ! delete branch
* Tree t
* Stage c
	* u stage/unstage chunk
* Grep g
* Pager p
* Stash y
	* A apply
	* P pop
	* ! drop

* enter to open

* Opens "Splits"
	* Cycle with tab
	* No indication of which you're in
	* O Maximise

* Searching
	* / ? n N

* e edit

* Command mod
* : Internal commands
* :! Arbitrary shell commands

* If you want a git interface that does everything
	* This might the choice

* Still no crating branches or remotes

* Only scratching the surface
	* Tig and tigrc docs
	* Anything not supported
	* Can be added in
	* Incredibly well documented
