* Coc is probably the most popular vim completion tool
  * I know YCM has it's fans but that's not the topic of today
  * Today we're looking at Coc marketplace
  * Basically a helper to find Coc Extensions

== Usage ==
* :CocList search for marketplace
* Easier to just do CocList marketplace
  * Instantly runs the command
  * From here anything with tick is installed
  * Anything with a x is not installed
  * Anything with an * is by developer of coc
  * Search by just typing
    * As you can see is a fuzzy finder
* Pass in search query to match on query

* Select a plugin to install it
  * If it's already installed it will be updated
  * Sadly you can't use this to uninstall
  * That would be a nice addition

* By default searches npmjs.com for plugins
* Set marketplace.npmsio
  * To use npms.io instead
  * I had never previously heard of this website
  * I guess some people don't like npmjs search
    * I don't know, I always just download specific libraries

== Installation Note ==
* Keep in mind, because this is a coc plugin
  * Install it with coc not your vim plugin manager

== Why ==
* Most plugins are well named
  * css, json, python, angular
  * Sometimes though not as obvious
    * tsserver
      * Which is the typescript extension
    * vimtex
      * For latex
    * explorer
      * A vim file tree

* Find your coc plugins without leaving vim
  * I don't want to go to npmjs or github

== Why Not ==
* Probably not going to be installing coc plugins for fun
  * It's quite rare when you'll want or need to change them
* A lot of languages only have 1 option
  * Latex and c# are exceptions
  * Could argue there's no point then

* Have to trust you're actually downloading a coc plugin
  * Not some random other js package pretending to be one
  * Probably not a serious thread
    * Good to keep in mind

== Closing ==
* I think it's a useful tool if
  * Maybe trying out the less language specific plugins
