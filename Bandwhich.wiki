* Basic idea of what connections are being made by your machine
	* Simple way to do so is bandwhich
	* By the same developer as Diskonaut

* By default shows utilization by process
	* Not much going on
	* Open up brave
		* Tremc shows python
	* Number of connections
		* Open a website
	* Upload and download
		* Few things that normal person might want this for
	* Maybe forgot about a torrent seeding
		* File downloading

* Next same info sorted by address
	* IPv4
	* Sometimes IPv6
	* Domain
		* Can be disabled with -n
	* Any point can pause with space
	* Check out on somewhere like WhoIs
		* More to it then this but network security is not my forte

* Requires sudo access to run
	* Or make setcap wrapper

* Utilization by address
	* Network device ip port => ip port transport protocol
		* Generally will see UDP (User Datagram Protocol)
			* TCP (Transport Control Protocol)
			* Might leave links to how they work down below

* Shows current connected network interfaces
	* Connect a 2nd device works just fine
	* Wired and Wifi

* Shuffle around UI
	* Tab
	* Only forward, is only 3

* Disable certain parts of UI
	* -a for addresses
	* -c connections
	* -p processes

* Issues
	* Can't scroll windows
		* Hinders usability

* Show dns queries (Domain name system)
	* Resolves IP addresses to domains
	* -s

* Show total usage
	* -t
	* Totals not cleared off screen
	* Useful for benchmarking

* Machine processable mode
	* -r

* Serious packet sniffing should be done in wireshark
	* But it's a bit overkill for most people
