* One of things people say is great about emacs is org mode
	* Really powerful mode for note taking
	* Document structuring
	* What if I said there was a plugin to replicate in vim
		* Been a work in progress for a long time
		* Nowhere near complete but has a lot of features
	* Vim org mode

* I use vimwiki for notes
	* Let's say you had nothing
	* Or wanted to clean up config

* Heading
*
**
***
<localleader>hN  - insert heading above
<localleader>hh  - insert heading below, taking over children
<localleader>hn  - insert heading above, after children

* Dates
<localleader>sa     - insert date
<localleader>si     - insert inactive date
<localleader>pa     - insert date by using calendar selection
<localleader>pi     - insert inactive date by using calendar selection
* Involved with agendas
	* For now just accept that you can date stamp
* ctrl-a ctrl-x modify date
	* Weird behaviour without speeddating

* Change level
>> or >ah       - demote heading
<< or <ah       - promote heading
>ar             - demote subtree
<ar             - promote subtree

<TAB>           - Cycle Visibility

* Tags
* Easily find headings
<localleader>st add tag
<localleader>ft find tag

* Plain List
* Checkboxes
- [ ]
+ [ ]
* [ ]
	* Makes no sense
1. [ ]
1 [ ]
	* Docs are wrong

Add [%] or [/] to see how much is done

<localleader>cc         Toggle checkbox status or (with prefix arg) checkbox
                        presence at point.

<localleader>cn    or
<CR> or <S-CR>          Insert a new checkbox below current line.

<localleader>cN    or
<C-S-CR>                Insert a new checkbox above current line.

* TODO
<localleader>ct Cycle todo states

[%] or [/] supposed to work

* Agenda related bindings are broken
* caa agenda for week
* cat agenda of todos

* Local works
	* caT for todos
	* caA for agenda doesn't work

* Documentation is a mess
	* Tons of sections with not yet implemented
	* Much harder to read than it should be

* Much like vim emulation in Visual Studio
	* Org mode emulation in vim isn't great
	* If you want it use emacs
	* If you want good note taking in vim use vimwiki
	* If you want the feature subset fine
