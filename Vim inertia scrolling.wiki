== Intro ==
* Has scrolling in vim ever felt too accurate
	* If yes have you considered inertial scolling
 I kid
	* Adds scrolling speed based on scroll duration

== Demo ==
* Ctrl-d to scroll down
* Ctrl-u to scroll up

* Ctrl-f to scroll down more
* ctrl-b to scroll up more

* Not supported out of the box
	* Vim guis and terminal that support mouse scrolling
	* Work as well

== Configuration ==
* By default scrolls your screen
	* Ctrl-y and Ctrl-e
	* Change scroll key
		* Obvious choice is j and k
		* Any scroll key will work
		* h and l produce amusing results

* Add in mouse support
	* Discuss these numbers in just a bit

* Disable default mappings
	* So they don't get in the way of our changes

* Rebinding the movements
	* Do it if you want to maintain half page and page scroll

* 3 parameters to configure
	* Friction, air drag, and value in brackets impule
	* It gets weird no
		* Drag pretty sure divides impulse by value
		* Num of lines
	* Not sure how friction plays a part

* One last thing before the problems
	* If you want distance to be based on window height

== Issues ==
* No documentation kills this plugin
	* Without spending hours tweaking it's impossible to know result of vars
* If nothing else
	* Include formula in the README

* Even after experimenting I can only guess what variables do

== Final Thoughts ==
* Current state this is a cool experiment
	* But a terrible plugin
	* Massive pain to configure
* Inertial scrolling makes sense on a wheel
	* Where you have inertia
	* Doesn't translate to binary action
